1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:06,510
In this module we showed you two technologies Kubeflow and TensorFlow Lite,

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:10,450
that are important in hybrid Machine Learning Systems.

3
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:12,995
Kubeflow gives you composability,

4
00:00:12,995 --> 00:00:18,165
portability and scalability while preserving the ability to run everywhere.

5
00:00:18,165 --> 00:00:23,130
Specifically, Kubeflow offers portability and composability,

6
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,880
between your on-premises environment and Cloud ML Engine.

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,895
That trade-off is at Kubeflow is not serverless you will have to do cluster management.

8
00:00:32,895 --> 00:00:38,100
Still retaining the ability to move to cloud and serverless at

9
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:43,680
some point in the future offer some fraction of your workloads provides flexibility.

10
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,315
The presence of Kubeflow also limits locking.

11
00:00:47,315 --> 00:00:50,090
You can always take your models of Google Cloud,

12
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:54,820
and you have a way to continue training and serving those models.

13
00:00:54,850 --> 00:01:00,140
TensorFlow Lite make specific compromises to enable

14
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:05,105
machine-learning inference on low power or under-resourced devices.

15
00:01:05,105 --> 00:01:09,365
For example, you can convert variable nodes into constant nodes

16
00:01:09,365 --> 00:01:14,445
which streamlines your model because constant nodes are embedded in the graph itself.

17
00:01:14,445 --> 00:01:18,745
However, you sacrifice maintainability and portability,

18
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:22,395
since you cannot resume training from that model graph.

19
00:01:22,395 --> 00:01:28,220
Another compromise you might make is to use a less accurate model on the device.

20
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:32,055
Perhaps you quantize the nodes or you use a smaller model.

21
00:01:32,055 --> 00:01:35,090
Of course, we hope that you choose to train and

22
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:38,060
serve machine-learning models on Google Cloud, so,

23
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,640
you don't have to make these compromises or manage

24
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,810
all this infrastructure or train on low power devices.

25
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:50,930
But if business and real-world considerations require you to be able to train or

26
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:53,810
serve Machine Learning models outside

27
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:57,775
a cloud environment it's good to know that you have these options.

28
00:01:57,775 --> 00:02:03,515
So, Kubeflow and TensorFlow Lite are good to know about to have in your back pocket,

29
00:02:03,515 --> 00:02:06,480
when such situations arise.
