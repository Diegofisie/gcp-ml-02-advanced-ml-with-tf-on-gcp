1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,335
Let's look at a second scenario,

2
00:00:03,335 --> 00:00:06,195
where hybrid models are necessary.

3
00:00:06,195 --> 00:00:10,720
Remember this example from earlier in our first course?

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,530
We saw that applications are

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,915
increasingly combining machine learning with mobile applications.

6
00:00:17,915 --> 00:00:20,260
Google Translate, for example,

7
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:24,310
is a combination of several models: one model to find the sign,

8
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:27,100
another model to read the sign and do OCR on it,

9
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,390
a third model to translate the sign,

10
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:32,010
a fourth model to superimpose translated text.

11
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:35,340
The idea is that ML allows you to add intelligence to

12
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,330
your mobile applications such as image and voice recognition,

13
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,679
translation and natural language processing.

14
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:47,235
Also, you can apply the technology for smarter analytics on mobile specific data.

15
00:00:47,235 --> 00:00:50,300
For example, you can use machine learning for detecting

16
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:56,205
certain patterns from motion or GPS tracking data. Why is that?

17
00:00:56,205 --> 00:01:00,860
This is because machine learning can extract the meaning from the raw data.

18
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:04,700
For example, if you want to do image recognition with your mobile app,

19
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,735
the easiest way to send the raw image to the Cloud

20
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:11,430
and let the Cloud service recognize the objects in the image.

21
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:15,680
But, if you have a neural network algorithm running on your mobile app,

22
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,150
you can get the labels of the objects and then send them to the Cloud.

23
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:21,230
It's tens or hundreds of times more

24
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:25,185
efficient to collect the object labels on the Cloud service.

25
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:26,510
So, as an example,

26
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:30,050
if you do motion detection with your mobile app and you run

27
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:33,890
a neural network to extract a feature vector from that sensor data,

28
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:38,740
the bunch of numbers in the feature vector represents a signature of each motion.

29
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:39,890
So, you don't have to send

30
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:44,035
the raw video sequence or raw motion data to the Cloud service.

31
00:01:44,035 --> 00:01:50,305
You can do the inference on the mobile and send just the results to the Cloud service,

32
00:01:50,305 --> 00:01:53,860
and that involves less network transfer,

33
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,685
it's a lot more efficient.

34
00:01:55,685 --> 00:02:00,560
Also, by applying machine learning technology to mobile apps,

35
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,200
you can reduce network bandwidth and you can get

36
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,455
faster response when you're communicating with the Cloud services.

37
00:02:07,455 --> 00:02:10,715
We can delegate to a Microservice,

38
00:02:10,715 --> 00:02:13,635
like we were running everything in the Cloud.

39
00:02:13,635 --> 00:02:16,245
So now, we want a library,

40
00:02:16,245 --> 00:02:20,780
a library that we can invoke directly on the mobile device and

41
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:25,600
not a Web service that we have to call out over the network.

42
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,775
So, in situations like this,

43
00:02:27,775 --> 00:02:30,295
we would like to train on the Cloud,

44
00:02:30,295 --> 00:02:33,409
but do the predictions on the device.

45
00:02:33,409 --> 00:02:36,385
So, we don't want to call out to a Microservice,

46
00:02:36,385 --> 00:02:41,385
instead we want to embed the model within the device itself.

47
00:02:41,385 --> 00:02:43,820
So, how do we do that?
