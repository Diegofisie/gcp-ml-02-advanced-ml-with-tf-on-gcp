1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:05,320
In the first module of this course on
production machine learning systems,

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:09,950
we discussed many of the things that
the system should be able to do.

3
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:14,490
And the components that take
responsibility for doing these things.

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:19,970
We also discussed important decisions
that system architects will have to make.

5
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:23,600
For training, whether we do dynamic
training or static training,

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,760
and the same for inference.

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,670
The answers to these questions
drives the architecture.

8
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,984
And finally, you got to practice
designing and architecture from scratch.

9
00:00:34,984 --> 00:00:39,590
In the second module, we talked about
how to bring your data to the cloud.

10
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:42,460
We covered transfer methods like gsutil to

11
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,420
directly ingest data into
Google Cloud Storage.

12
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,820
The transfer appliance that we shipped to
you to fill up and you should be back.

13
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,350
We talked about cloud
storage transfer service,

14
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:56,740
which is a great way to transfer
data between regions at Google.

15
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:01,540
And the BigQuery transfer service that
automates loading data into BigQuery

16
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:03,748
from a variety of sources.

17
00:01:03,748 --> 00:01:09,330
In module three, we talked about change,
how it affects machine learning systems,

18
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:14,300
and what we can do to mitigate,
to reduce those effects.

19
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:19,260
And in module four, we talked about how
to squeeze the most performance out

20
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:24,710
of the machine learning system by choosing
the right hardware removing bottles.

21
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:30,040
And in module five, we talked the high
level about the technology behind hybrid

22
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:36,240
systems, which might run on the Cloud,
on the Edge or on-premises.

23
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,610
And that's a wrap for
Production Machine Learning Systems.

24
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:43,490
We'll see you in the next course
on Image Classifications Models.

25
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:47,940
Where we will delve into convolutional
networks, transfer learning and

26
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,770
tensor processing units.

27
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:50,270
Thank you.
