1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,360
And just as everything needs to talk to everything else,

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,845
the users of the system need to be able to easily accomplish their tasks,

3
00:00:06,845 --> 00:00:09,635
and as central a location as possible.

4
00:00:09,635 --> 00:00:13,455
In GCP, you can use TensorBoard and Cloud ML Engine.

5
00:00:13,455 --> 00:00:17,835
TensorBoard is the visualization software that comes bundled with TensorFlow.

6
00:00:17,835 --> 00:00:20,520
We saw in the first specialization about how it can

7
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,040
be used to look at loss curves as models train,

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,160
but TensorBoard is actually capable of a lot more.

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,130
Out of the box, it comes ready to visualize the graphs of

10
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,405
your models and the distributions of things like weights.

11
00:00:32,405 --> 00:00:34,545
Additionally, it's possible to write

12
00:00:34,545 --> 00:00:37,410
custom visualization modules for other types of input,

13
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:40,000
and people have done so for sound and images.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,540
TensorBoard is also capable of showing what the model has learned about the input space,

15
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:47,510
which you can see in the projector tab in the interface.

16
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:51,050
We'll talk about this more in a later course on sequence models,

17
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,165
but you can get a sense of what this part of the interface

18
00:00:53,165 --> 00:00:56,420
looks like at projectory.tensorflow.org.

19
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:01,055
In the demo, the points represent the meanings of words in semantic space.

20
00:01:01,055 --> 00:01:03,445
If you type a word in the right hand search bar,

21
00:01:03,445 --> 00:01:07,505
you can find all of the semantically similar words that the model has learned.

22
00:01:07,505 --> 00:01:11,930
We've also just recently added the ability to debug models in an environment

23
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:15,995
similar to what you'd find within an IDE with line-by-line execution,

24
00:01:15,995 --> 00:01:17,750
and the ability to set break points,

25
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,395
and view the contents of tensors in the graph.

26
00:01:20,395 --> 00:01:23,230
This is an alpha feature though.

27
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:28,160
Storage is necessary for staging intermediate output of these components.

28
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,460
In GCP that's Google Cloud Storage.
