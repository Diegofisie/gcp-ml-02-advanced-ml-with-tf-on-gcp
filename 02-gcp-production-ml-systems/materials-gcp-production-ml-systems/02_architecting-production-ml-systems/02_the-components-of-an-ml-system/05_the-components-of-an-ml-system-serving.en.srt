1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,435
Next we'll talk about the serving component.

2
00:00:02,435 --> 00:00:06,510
The serving component should be low-latency to respond to users quickly.

3
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:10,200
Highly efficient so that many instances can be run simultaneously,

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,705
and scale horizontally in order to be reliable and robust to failures.

5
00:00:14,705 --> 00:00:18,300
In contrast to training when we care about scaling with our data,

6
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,070
at serving we care about responding to

7
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:25,270
variable user demand maximizing throughput and minimizing response latency.

8
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:30,130
Another important feature, it should be easy to update to new versions of the model.

9
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:33,100
When we get new data or engineer new features,

10
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,120
we'll want to retrain and push a new version of the model and you

11
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,795
want the system to seamlessly transition to the new model version.

12
00:00:39,795 --> 00:00:42,500
More generally, the system should allow you to set up

13
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,710
a multi-armed bandit architecture to verify which model versions are the best.

14
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,200
Just as with training, there are two options for serving on GCP.

15
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,720
You can either use a fully managed TensorFlow serving service which is

16
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,905
ML Engine or you can run TF serving on Kubernetes engine.

17
00:00:57,905 --> 00:01:01,295
The next component we'll look at is logging.

18
00:01:01,295 --> 00:01:05,180
Logging is critical for debugging and comparison and what's

19
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:08,665
important is that all logs be easily accessible and integrated.

20
00:01:08,665 --> 00:01:13,220
With cloud reliability, you get easy integration with all the other GCP products,

21
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:15,110
the ability to craft alerting policies,

22
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:18,620
and the ability to detect when new errors occur.
