Hi, I'm Valentine Fontama.

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:08,400
I'm a machine learning and AI practice lead at Google Professional Services.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:14,360
I want to warmly welcome you to this second course in our advanced specialization.

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:19,425
The second course is on building production ML models.

5
00:00:19,425 --> 00:00:21,855
The considerations behind them,

6
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:24,820
static training, dynamic training,

7
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:27,865
static inference, dynamic inference,

8
00:00:27,865 --> 00:00:31,795
distributed TensorFlow, and TPUs.

9
00:00:31,795 --> 00:00:36,000
So far, we've focused our attention on how to build

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,420
models that can do a good job predicting on previously unseen data.

11
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:45,980
That of course, is the heart of any machine learning system.

12
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:49,790
But real-world production ML systems are

13
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:55,415
large ecosystem of which the model code itself is just a small part.

14
00:00:55,415 --> 00:00:59,165
The rest, consists of code that perform

15
00:00:59,165 --> 00:01:04,010
critical functions some of which we've seen already like data pipelining,

16
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:06,435
and some that we've not.

17
00:01:06,435 --> 00:01:11,600
This course is devoted to exploring the characteristics that make for

18
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,925
a good ML system beyond its ability to make good predictions.

19
00:01:16,925 --> 00:01:20,690
We'll start at a high level in module one,

20
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:25,830
where we will discuss many of the things that the system should be able to do,

21
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:30,570
and the components that take responsibility for doing these things.

22
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:37,770
We'll also review two important decisions that system architects will have to make.

23
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:44,270
In module two, we'll talk about how to bring your data to the Cloud because that's

24
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,720
a prerequisite for much of the system's architecture we

25
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:52,475
discuss in this course and indeed in this specialization.

26
00:01:52,475 --> 00:01:56,925
In module three, we'll talk about change.

27
00:01:56,925 --> 00:01:59,535
How it can affect an ML system,

28
00:01:59,535 --> 00:02:03,865
and what we can do to mitigate those effects?

29
00:02:03,865 --> 00:02:09,860
In module four, we'll talk about how to squeeze the most performance out of

30
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:16,180
your ML system by choosing the right hardware and removing bottlenecks.

31
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:19,385
Finally, in module five,

32
00:02:19,385 --> 00:02:24,600
we'll talk at a high level about the technology behind hybrid systems,

33
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,885
which may run on the Cloud,

34
00:02:26,885 --> 00:02:30,880
or the Edge, or in fact, on-premises.

35
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,490
I'll now hand it over to my colleague Max,

36
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:39,150
who will start us off with architecting production ML systems.
