00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,250
Hi, I'm Val.

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,265
I'm Machine Learning and AI Specialist at Google.

3
00:00:05,265 --> 00:00:11,105
I want to warmly welcome you to the second course in our advanced specialization.

4
00:00:11,105 --> 00:00:16,515
In this module, we'll talk about how to bring your data to the cloud.

5
00:00:16,515 --> 00:00:19,805
There are many ways to bring your data to the cloud,

6
00:00:19,805 --> 00:00:22,475
to power your machine learning models.

7
00:00:22,475 --> 00:00:27,435
First, we'll review why your data needs to be on the cloud,

8
00:00:27,435 --> 00:00:32,230
to get the advantages of scale and using fully managed services,

9
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:36,010
and what options you have to bring your data over.

10
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:42,320
Next, we will discuss several common scenarios for where your data currently is,

11
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,550
and the best ways you can bring it to the Google Cloud Platform.

12
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:50,720
These scenarios are, having data on

13
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:55,505
premise and using common tools like gsutil to transfer.

14
00:00:55,505 --> 00:00:59,450
Next, is working with large datasets and

15
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:03,990
how typical networks can bottleneck at large scale.

16
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:07,775
Then, we'll cover if your data is already on

17
00:01:07,775 --> 00:01:12,575
other clouds and how you can set up scheduled transfers.

18
00:01:12,575 --> 00:01:19,275
Lastly, if you have existing databases with structured or unstructured data,

19
00:01:19,275 --> 00:01:25,360
what ways you have to ingest into what Cloud-based database products.

20
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,030
One of the key fully managed services

21
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:32,375
we've discussed in previous lectures on architecture,

22
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:36,810
was Cloud ML Engine or CMLE.

23
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:44,235
As you recall, CMLE supports ML data in both batch and streaming form,

24
00:01:44,235 --> 00:01:48,170
but the key is your data must be in the cloud

25
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:53,545
before you can get any of the benefits of these fully managed services.

26
00:01:53,545 --> 00:02:00,705
While data migration may be an easy effort if you only have a few small datasets,

27
00:02:00,705 --> 00:02:04,145
it's often much harder problem to tackle.

28
00:02:04,145 --> 00:02:08,215
Now let's cover a few of the key migration challenges.

29
00:02:08,215 --> 00:02:13,515
Here are some of the common data migration challenges our customers often run into.

30
00:02:13,515 --> 00:02:18,135
First is the sheer volume of data captured and stored,

31
00:02:18,135 --> 00:02:21,300
because data is growing exponentially.

32
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:25,310
At digital market forecast research report by ESG,

33
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:29,845
has unstructured data growth at about 56 percent year on year.

34
00:02:29,845 --> 00:02:35,745
In fact, we see plenty of data growth rates of up to two times a year.

35
00:02:35,745 --> 00:02:38,105
With more and more data,

36
00:02:38,105 --> 00:02:41,899
resources are simply overwhelmed and networks are constrained.

37
00:02:41,899 --> 00:02:45,980
Next, having dedicated bandwidth for data transfers is

38
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:50,660
often too expensive and it will disrupt normal operations of the business,

39
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,970
and building new network infrastructure is not

40
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:57,415
typical expertise or time that IT departments have readily available.

41
00:02:57,415 --> 00:03:02,240
Which is why Google Cloud Platform offers a suite of solutions that enable you

42
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:07,355
to move data to GCP fast regardless of the data's location or type,

43
00:03:07,355 --> 00:03:11,420
your network size, and utilization or its planned use.

44
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:14,260
Let's cover some of these options now.

45
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,870
First is online transfers.

46
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:19,970
Gsutil is a command line interface that many

47
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:23,675
of our customers use to get their data into GCS.

48
00:03:23,675 --> 00:03:27,640
We also offer easy drag-and-drop folders in Chrome.

49
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,890
Next is a transfer appliance.

50
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:33,830
A rackable high-capacity storage server that we

51
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:37,525
shipped to you to fill it up and ship it back to us.

52
00:03:37,525 --> 00:03:41,570
One hundred terabytes and half petabyte versions that,

53
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:47,045
with compression, could transfer 200 terabytes or up to a petabyte.

54
00:03:47,045 --> 00:03:54,230
It's best used for lots of data where your network situation won't meet transfer demands.

55
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:59,555
After that, is a cloud storage transfer service that we call Cloud-2-Cloud.

56
00:03:59,555 --> 00:04:01,855
Common use cases are migrating off of

57
00:04:01,855 --> 00:04:06,760
other cloud buckets or often backing up other cloud bucket data.

58
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:12,300
It's also a great way to transfer large amounts of data between regions at Google.

59
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:15,320
Lastly, is a BigQuery transfer service,

60
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:19,160
which automates loading data into BigQuery from YouTube,

61
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,270
Google AdWords, and Double-click.

62
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:24,400
We also have many partners that provide options

63
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,625
for each of these use cases and often compliment

64
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:29,410
these use cases.

65
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:33,370
These transfer solutions were designed to help you take

66
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:36,950
advantage of GCP as quickly as possible.

67
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:41,195
For example, media archive migration can be

68
00:04:41,195 --> 00:04:46,960
accelerated with the transfer appliance and cost-effectively stored in cold line,

69
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,870
but still served with low latency whenever needed.

70
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:56,405
AdWords data can flow directly into BigQuery for analysis,

71
00:04:56,405 --> 00:05:02,320
or in fact, Cloud storage transfer service could be used to backup your s3 data.
