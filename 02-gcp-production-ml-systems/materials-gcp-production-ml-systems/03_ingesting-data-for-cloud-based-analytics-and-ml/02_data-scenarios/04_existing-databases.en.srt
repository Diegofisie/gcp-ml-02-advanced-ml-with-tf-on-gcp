1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,880
The last data migration scenario we will cover,

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:08,890
is data that already exists in your database application.

3
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:11,849
There are several options for migrating

4
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:16,799
existing databases to Google Cloud's fully managed options.

5
00:00:16,799 --> 00:00:20,864
These include the BigQuery data transfer service,

6
00:00:20,864 --> 00:00:23,070
migrations to Cloud SQL,

7
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,155
and Spanner for your relational data bases.

8
00:00:26,155 --> 00:00:29,900
And Cloud Dataproc for your Hadoop jobs and more.

9
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:34,790
It can be overwhelming when choosing from different database options.

10
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:37,955
We've broken down the decision path here.

11
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:43,715
Do you have structured log data from monitoring IoT applications?

12
00:00:43,715 --> 00:00:48,070
If so, consider BigTable or Spanner.

13
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:54,010
What about relational data from an on-premise MySQL database?

14
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:58,660
For that, consider Cloud SQL or Spanner.

15
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:04,085
What about migrating your data analytics and reporting warehouse?

16
00:01:04,085 --> 00:01:08,295
For that, consider BigQuery.

17
00:01:08,295 --> 00:01:12,845
What about your existing legacy Hadoop jobs?

18
00:01:12,845 --> 00:01:16,180
For those, I'll use Dataproc,

19
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:20,839
and run those same jobs inside of a fully managed service.

20
00:01:20,839 --> 00:01:24,320
You've already worked with BigQuery before as part of this course.

21
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,910
But did you know there's

22
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:31,530
a fully managed data import service for bringing in data sets from AdWords,

23
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:35,120
DoubleClick, and YouTube into BigQuery?

24
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,420
Meet the BigQuery data transfer service.

25
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,870
Now you can use BigQuery to

26
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:44,590
analyze the results of your online marketing campaigns for example.

27
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:48,600
When looking to migrate your on-premise database application,

28
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,345
like Oracle, SQL Server, or MySQL,

29
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:56,270
consider working with a partner to set up a migration plan,

30
00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:01,370
and switch over your on-premise infrastructure to a no NoOps fully managed solution,

31
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:04,425
like Cloud SQL, or SQL Spanner.

32
00:02:04,425 --> 00:02:09,650
Lastly, if you have existing MapReduce Hadoop jobs,

33
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:14,935
you can bring these over too and run them, within Cloud Dataproc.

34
00:02:14,935 --> 00:02:19,160
You practiced running a few of these jobs in a VM,

35
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,930
in the very first part of the ML on GCP course.

36
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:27,075
You can also leverage and work with our partner ecosystem,

37
00:02:27,075 --> 00:02:29,330
to assist you in the migration.
