Hi, I'm Laurence and

2
00:00:01,503 --> 00:00:05,486
I'm a developer advocate on Google
brain focused on intensive flow.

3
00:00:05,486 --> 00:00:08,920
In this course, you're going to
be learning the considerations

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:13,276
behind architecting and implementing
production machine learning systems.

5
00:00:13,276 --> 00:00:17,264
Now one key consideration of
this of course is performance.

6
00:00:17,264 --> 00:00:21,833
In this module, you'll learn how to
identify performance considerations from

7
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:23,454
machine learning modules.

8
00:00:23,454 --> 00:00:26,196
Now machine learning models
are not all identical.

9
00:00:26,196 --> 00:00:30,299
For some models you'll be focused
on improving IO performance and

10
00:00:30,299 --> 00:00:34,998
on others, you'll be focused on
squeezing out more computational speed.

11
00:00:34,998 --> 00:00:39,806
Depending on what you're focus is,
you will need different ML infrastructure.

12
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:43,504
Whether you decide to scale
out with multiple machines or

13
00:00:43,504 --> 00:00:46,440
scale up on a single machine with a GPO or
TPM.

14
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,784
Sometimes you might even to do both
by using a machine with multiple

15
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:52,811
accelerators attached to it.

16
00:00:52,811 --> 00:00:55,113
Now it's not just the hardware choice,

17
00:00:55,113 --> 00:00:59,593
the hardware is select also inform your
choice of the distribution strategy.

18
00:00:59,593 --> 00:01:01,401
This is a fast evolving area and

19
00:01:01,401 --> 00:01:05,298
some of the things that we show you
are still are very alpha stage and

20
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:08,580
evolve contributions from
the tends of low community.
