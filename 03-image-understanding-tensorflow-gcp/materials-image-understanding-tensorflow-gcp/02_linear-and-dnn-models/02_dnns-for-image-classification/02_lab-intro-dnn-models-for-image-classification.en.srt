00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,190
Now that you've seen how neural networks can tackle

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:04,550
more difficult datasets like this one,

3
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:06,165
let's see how a deep neural network,

4
00:00:06,165 --> 00:00:09,865
many layers, performs on your MNIST dataset from before.

5
00:00:09,865 --> 00:00:12,100
We've got the same objectives that we had prior,

6
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,575
but this time we've got a little bit more of a complex model,

7
00:00:14,575 --> 00:00:15,790
your deep neural network.

8
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:18,960
You'll see that when you're creating the layers of your neural network,

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,800
in specifying your activation function in your code,

10
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,420
the overall process will be similar to what you did before.

11
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,100
You import the training dataset of MNIST handwritten images,

12
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,540
then reshape and preprosses the image data,

13
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:32,064
set up your neural network model with those 10 classes,

14
00:00:32,064 --> 00:00:35,935
then define and create your EstimatorSpec and TensorFlow to create your custom estimator,

15
00:00:35,935 --> 00:00:38,210
then you're going to define and run your train and evaluate

16
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,460
function to train against your input dataset,

17
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:44,160
and ultimately evaluate your neural network models performance on the dataset.

18
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,900
Give it a try and come back,

19
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,790
and we'll compare performance.
