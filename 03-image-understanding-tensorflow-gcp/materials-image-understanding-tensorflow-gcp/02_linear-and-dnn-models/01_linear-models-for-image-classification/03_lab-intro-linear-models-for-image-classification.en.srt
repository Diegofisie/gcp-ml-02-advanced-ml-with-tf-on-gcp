1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,620
Now, it's time for you to put your linear model to the test using the MNIST dataset.

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,195
How do you think it will do?

3
00:00:06,195 --> 00:00:10,095
In this lab, you will import the training dataset of MNIST handwritten images,

4
00:00:10,095 --> 00:00:12,675
you'll reshape and preprocess the image data,

5
00:00:12,675 --> 00:00:15,980
then you'll set up your linear classifier model with ten classes,

6
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:18,080
one for each possible digits zero to nine.

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,190
Then, you'll define and create your estimator spec in

8
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,450
TensorFlow to create your custom estimator.

9
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:26,000
Then, you'll define and run your training and evaluate function to train against

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,460
the input dataset in 60,000 images and evaluate your model's performance.

11
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:34,740
But keep in mind, you have multiple attempts to start and stop each of these Qwiklabs.

12
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,435
So, don't worry if you didn't make it through all the way on the first try,

13
00:00:37,435 --> 00:00:40,250
or if you want to reverse engineer the code in the notebook and

14
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,640
experiment with it after completing the lab, you can do so.

15
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,740
We'll review the solution together in the following video.
