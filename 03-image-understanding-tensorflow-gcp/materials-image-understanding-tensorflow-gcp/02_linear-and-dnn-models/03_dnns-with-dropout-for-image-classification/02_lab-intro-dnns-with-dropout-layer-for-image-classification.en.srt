1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,910
Now, let's add the final piece to our neural network puzzle.

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:06,190
When I add a layer for dropout to our previous neural network model,

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:08,620
and see how that impacts performance.

4
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,400
The overall process will be still similar to what we did before,

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,910
except that this time you're adding a new layer for dropout to

6
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:17,430
your DNN and then specifying that probability parameter.

7
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,240
Complete the lab, again you have multiple attempts,

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,340
and return back here we'll walk through the solution together.
