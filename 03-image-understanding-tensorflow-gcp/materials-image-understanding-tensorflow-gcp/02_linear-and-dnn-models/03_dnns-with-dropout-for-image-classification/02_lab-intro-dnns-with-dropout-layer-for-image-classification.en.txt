Now, let's add the final piece to our neural network puzzle. When I add a layer for dropout to our previous neural network model, and see how that impacts performance. The overall process will be still similar to what we did before, except that this time you're adding a new layer for dropout to your DNN and then specifying that probability parameter. Complete the lab, again you have multiple attempts, and return back here we'll walk through the solution together.
