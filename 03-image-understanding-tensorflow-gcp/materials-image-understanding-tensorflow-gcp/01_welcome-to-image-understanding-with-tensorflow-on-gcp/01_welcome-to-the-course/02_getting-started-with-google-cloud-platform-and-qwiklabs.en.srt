00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,200
Hello and welcome. I'm Philipp Maier,

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,920
a course developer with Google Cloud Platform and

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,210
this is a brief tutorial on using Qwiklabs in this course.

4
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:12,620
I'm about to show you the interactive hands on Labs platform called Qwiklabs,

5
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:14,400
which is part of Google Cloud.

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,320
Qwiklabs allows you to get practical hands on experience with GCP and

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,900
provisions you with Google account credentials so you

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,190
can access that GCP Console at no cost.

9
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:29,760
The first step is to log into Coursera in an incognito window.

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,170
Depending on your browser,

11
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:35,235
it may also be called private browsing or inprivate browsing.

12
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:39,110
Logging into Coursera from a private window ensures that you don't

13
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:43,520
accidentally use your own Google account while accessing the Google Cloud Console.

14
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,165
We don't want you to get any unexpected bills at the end of the month.

15
00:00:47,165 --> 00:00:51,695
Check out the links below this video for different browser support articles.

16
00:00:51,695 --> 00:00:55,085
Once logged into Coursera using an incognito window,

17
00:00:55,085 --> 00:00:59,250
return to your course and go to the lab activity page.

18
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:02,640
So, if prompt that you want to accept

19
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,660
the owner code and you might even have to enter your name,

20
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:12,740
then you want to click the Open Tool button to open the lab in a new tab.

21
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:16,875
So, within the new tab, you can now click

22
00:01:16,875 --> 00:01:22,890
Start Lab and you want to wait until the Lab running is displayed.

23
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:31,000
For each lab you will have a timer in the top right with the remaining axis time.

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,795
Your lab will automatically end when the timer runs out.

25
00:01:34,795 --> 00:01:38,230
On the left you have the Connections Detail.

26
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:42,130
Click Open Google Console and then

27
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:46,455
sign in with the username and password provided in the Connections Detail pane.

28
00:01:46,455 --> 00:01:49,400
So, I'm going to copy the username,

29
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,940
paste that in here, I'm also going to take the password,

30
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:58,890
paste it in here, too.

31
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,030
Now, Qwiklabs creates a new account for you each time you launch a lab.

32
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,870
Therefore, you need to click through the initial account setup Windows.

33
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:09,390
So, essentially, I need to accept this.

34
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:15,550
I don't need to add any recover phone number so I can just click done.

35
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:22,380
I'm going to agree to the terms and services and I don't need any emails.

36
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:27,170
Now, I can verify that I'm using the Qwiklabs

37
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:30,635
provided account and project within the GCP Console.

38
00:02:30,635 --> 00:02:36,440
So, up here, I see the project ID and over

39
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,760
here I can see

40
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,430
the username and these are

41
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:44,145
the same ones that I was provided with in the Connections Detail pane.

42
00:02:44,145 --> 00:02:48,045
You can also see that the timer is still running.

43
00:02:48,045 --> 00:02:53,010
Now, some labs track your work within the Qwiklabs provided GCP project.

44
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:55,400
If it is enabled, you'll see a score in

45
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,375
the top right corner of the cQwiklabs window as you can see right here.

46
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:03,080
Your score increases as objectives are met and you can click on

47
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,350
the score to view the individual steps to be scored.

48
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,935
Now that I've completed the lab,

49
00:03:09,935 --> 00:03:15,870
I can see my score has been updated and I'm ready to click End Lab.

50
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,555
Once I click End Lab,

51
00:03:17,555 --> 00:03:23,100
the Qwiklabs provided project and any resources within that project will be deleted.

52
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,810
You can close the Qwiklabs lab page and

53
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:31,025
my grade will be updated with my lab score in Coursera.

54
00:03:31,025 --> 00:03:32,810
That's it for this tutorial.

55
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:36,430
Remember to launch Coursera in an Incognito window and use the Qwiklabs

56
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:40,045
provided credentials to sign in to the GCP console.

57
00:03:40,045 --> 00:03:43,420
Good luck with the labs and enjoy the rest of this course.
