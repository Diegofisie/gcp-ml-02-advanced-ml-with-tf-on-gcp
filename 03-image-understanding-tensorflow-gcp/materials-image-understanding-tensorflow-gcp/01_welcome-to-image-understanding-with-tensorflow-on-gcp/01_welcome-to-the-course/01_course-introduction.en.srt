00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,870
Hi, I'm Evan, my Big Data curriculum developer for Google Cloud.

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:05,870
We're excited to share with you today the history,

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:08,680
the methods, and the latest in theory and hardware advances,

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,280
that'll help us tackle the difficult domain of extracting

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,075
features from and ultimately classifying image data.

6
00:00:15,075 --> 00:00:17,460
This is the third course in the Advanced Machine Learning with

7
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,770
TensorFlow on GCP specialization.

8
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,420
In this course, we'll look at

9
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,450
the different strategies for building image classifier using methods

10
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:26,270
that you've seen before as well as

11
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:29,365
a new model type called the Convolutional Neural Network.

12
00:00:29,365 --> 00:00:33,740
We'll improve the model's accuracy with augmentation, feature extraction,

13
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:35,600
and fine tuning hyper parameters,

14
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,710
all the while trying to avoid over fitting or memorizing our training dataset.

15
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:41,750
We'll also look at some practical issues that

16
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,295
arise like not having enough image data to even train

17
00:00:44,295 --> 00:00:45,620
on and how to incorporate

18
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:49,515
the latest research findings into our models to overcome these challenges.

19
00:00:49,515 --> 00:00:52,040
You get hands-on practice building and optimizing

20
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,620
your own image classification models and a variety of

21
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:58,235
public datasets in the Qwiklabs that we're going work on together.

22
00:00:58,235 --> 00:01:02,450
In this course, you'll learn about the rapid growth and the high resolution image data

23
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:05,090
available in the types of business applications

24
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:08,055
that image classification models can be applied to.

25
00:01:08,055 --> 00:01:10,225
Then we'll cover how unstructured data like

26
00:01:10,225 --> 00:01:13,340
images is very different than that we've seen before.

27
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:17,410
Now, you can actually pre-process and feed that into your models.

28
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,420
After learning how to harness image data as input,

29
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:23,830
you'll then classify images using traditional machine learning techniques.

30
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:25,595
First, you'll use a linear model,

31
00:01:25,595 --> 00:01:26,990
then a neural network,

32
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:30,760
both using the popular MNIST handwritten digits dataset.

33
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:34,239
Then after you discover the limitations of these traditional methods,

34
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:38,035
you'll follow the rise of convolutional neural networks or CNNs.

35
00:01:38,035 --> 00:01:42,125
The major leap forward being that CNN allow a model to share weights,

36
00:01:42,125 --> 00:01:45,190
thus reducing the total number of weights and allowing the machine learning model to be

37
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:48,430
slightly more tolerant of variations in images.

38
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:50,495
When you practice it, it's pretty cool you'll see.

39
00:01:50,495 --> 00:01:53,780
Then we'll move on to a variety of tips and tricks that have been discovered

40
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,970
over time that work really well on image classification problems.

41
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:58,775
Here, you'll learn how to deal with things like

42
00:01:58,775 --> 00:02:02,165
data scarcity and improving the model performance through augmentation,

43
00:02:02,165 --> 00:02:06,445
batch normalization, and even leveraging some fun pre-built models.

44
00:02:06,445 --> 00:02:09,265
Now, one common problem you'll face out there in the wild,

45
00:02:09,265 --> 00:02:11,930
is that modern image classification models require

46
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:14,840
hundreds of thousands of images in order to work really well.

47
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,890
Now, one way to overcome this challenge is to leverage transfer learning.

48
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:21,285
You'll learn about that in a different module.

49
00:02:21,285 --> 00:02:23,450
Then you'll learn how to implement state of

50
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:27,320
the art image models and discover that they're really slow in standard hardware.

51
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:31,800
You'll then learn how to implement these models of your image data using TPUs or

52
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,320
Tensor Processing Units that's

53
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,645
specialized hardware and you can monitor your performance gain.

54
00:02:36,645 --> 00:02:43,310
Lastly, you can use pre-built models like Google Cloud Vision API or AutoML platforms.

55
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:47,030
Often these tools will be the first thing that you'll go to in your toolbox,

56
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,180
when you're faced with an image classification problem.

57
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:52,190
After all, in practice you don't want to reinvent the wheel,

58
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:57,190
if there's already a high-quality pre-trained model out there that you can use first.
