1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,965
In this introductory module,

2
00:00:01,965 --> 00:00:03,720
we'll review the business applications for

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,865
computer vision and modern image classification models.

4
00:00:06,865 --> 00:00:09,570
Then will break down images themselves as

5
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,260
just a collection of pixel data which has a height,

6
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:15,265
a width, and even a depth of color intensity.

7
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:17,850
Lastly, we'll brainstorm and compare the limits of

8
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:21,480
analyzing unstructured data with traditional methods.

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,930
While capturing an image into his digital form has been around since the 1970s,

10
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:27,900
getting computers to really understand

11
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,680
the subject matter or the meaning behind all those pixels,

12
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,700
has only recently made a huge strides in both research and application.

13
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,930
It's only within the last few years with the advent

14
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,030
of cloud computing and specialized processors,

15
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,020
that we can now classify many high-resolution images

16
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:45,500
quickly at scale and with high accuracy.

17
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:50,145
By 2006, more than half of all phones had integrated cameras.

18
00:00:50,145 --> 00:00:52,440
Now, a little more than 10 years later,

19
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,065
there're arguably more cameras and

20
00:00:54,065 --> 00:00:56,810
other sensors than the total number of people on the planet.

21
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:59,870
These phones in your pockets can capture high resolution,

22
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:03,560
millions of pixel images and automatically upload them to the cloud.

23
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,090
Just think of how many pictures you've taken in

24
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:07,740
the last year or have seen when browsing online.

25
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,410
To give you a sense of the scale of visual data,

26
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:11,895
it's both images and video,

27
00:01:11,895 --> 00:01:14,100
consider that as every second passes,

28
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,690
five hours of videos are uploaded to YouTube.

29
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:21,645
That's 300 hours of video every minute,

30
00:01:21,645 --> 00:01:23,995
and that's just data, video data to YouTube.

31
00:01:23,995 --> 00:01:29,495
For images, over 1.2 billion photos are uploaded every day to Google Photos,

32
00:01:29,495 --> 00:01:34,160
which is roughly 13,000 of high-resolution images every second.

33
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,880
Let's do a quick walk-through of how some companies and organizations are applying

34
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,750
intelligent computer vision and ML classification models for their businesses.

35
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:44,960
First, you might be Airbus and you're using

36
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,120
image classification and recognition techniques to

37
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,150
differentiate between clouds and snow cover.

38
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:54,010
Which is critical for planning safe flight routes and tracking weather patterns.

39
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:55,715
If you're stumped like I am,

40
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:57,800
the clouds are actually in the upper right-hand corner

41
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,325
of the right image highlighted in red.

42
00:02:00,325 --> 00:02:02,750
As you can see, the models have gotten really advanced in

43
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,560
the last decade. Let's take a look at another.

44
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,720
You might be Kewpie, and use machine-learning to differentiate between

45
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,110
bad potatoes and good potatoes while making baby food.

46
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:15,620
What's really impressive to me is that the team uses Tensorflow model with pictures of

47
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:19,190
diced potatoes like the ones that you see here as the image input,

48
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,915
not even the whole potato.

49
00:02:20,915 --> 00:02:23,150
After training, the model was able to pick out

50
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:25,550
the bad potatoes with near perfect accuracy,

51
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:30,415
which reduces the overall volume of cases for the plant workers to review themselves.

52
00:02:30,415 --> 00:02:32,945
Again, it's with the review of the foundations of

53
00:02:32,945 --> 00:02:35,945
ML that the team provided a labeled image

54
00:02:35,945 --> 00:02:41,370
of good high-quality data and bad diced potatoes and not hard-coded rules.

55
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:44,285
Like, if it's a green potato if you see that then it's bad.

56
00:02:44,285 --> 00:02:46,745
The model itself figures the rules between

57
00:02:46,745 --> 00:02:50,035
your training dataset that's labeled and ultimately the correct output.

58
00:02:50,035 --> 00:02:53,480
Next up, you might be an economic forecast firm looking at

59
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,885
track the global fleet of container ships via satellite imagery.

60
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:59,410
Knowing the amount of cargo being carried,

61
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:01,940
might improve your economic forecast days or months

62
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,720
ahead of the official numbers, you can track those ships.

63
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,100
After this course, if you want your practice your own

64
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,410
hand and image recognition on satellite imagery,

65
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:13,400
I'll provide a link to the public datasets and a cool weather prediction tutorial that [inaudible].

66
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,010
What about classifying medical images to help out doctors?

67
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:20,900
You can diagnose medical conditions like diabetic

68
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,840
retinopathy earlier when it's easier to treat and prevent blindness.

69
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,760
Diabetic retinopathy is one of the fastest growing causes of blindness.

70
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,450
With nearly 415 million diabetic patients at risk worldwide.

71
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:34,980
If caught early, the disease can be treated.

72
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,565
If not, it can lead to irreversible blindness.

73
00:03:37,565 --> 00:03:41,870
The Google Teams model showed that the results that ML algorithms performance is on

74
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:46,645
par with that of ophthalmologist who then use it in assisting and making diagnoses.

75
00:03:46,645 --> 00:03:48,740
I'll provide links for each of these different models in

76
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,105
the resources for your additional reading.

77
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:54,290
Now, the key takeaway here is that image classification can now automate

78
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:57,140
tasks that may save or even assist human team,

79
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,210
and recently, these models have been even

80
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:02,785
outperforming humans and some particular image domains.

81
00:04:02,785 --> 00:04:04,910
Image classification as a field,

82
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:07,475
is far more than just a binary classification tool.

83
00:04:07,475 --> 00:04:11,370
Later on in this course, we'll experiment with a pre-built vision API model,

84
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:14,180
which allows you to pass through a JSON request and get

85
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:17,235
back a ranked list of associated labels for your image.

86
00:04:17,235 --> 00:04:21,290
It's pretty good. Also, if you have more than one subject matter in one photo,

87
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:25,535
it can draw bounding boxes and classifying pieces of the image as well.

88
00:04:25,535 --> 00:04:28,760
Modern image classification models can even generate captions that

89
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,220
describe what's going on in an image like map of dependencies,

90
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,055
two hockey players are fighting over a puck.

91
00:04:35,055 --> 00:04:36,490
Here's important to call up that

92
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:38,960
even the best models can make mistakes with their predictions,

93
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,895
like a road sign here captioned as a refrigerator filled with lots of food and drinks.

94
00:04:43,895 --> 00:04:47,260
As you saw, there's a lot of really impressive use cases for machine learning,

95
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,085
like detecting objects and images,

96
00:04:49,085 --> 00:04:50,640
helping you to detect diseases,

97
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:55,620
even building real-time road data to enable cars to drive themselves.

98
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,440
But ML can also be used in more playful ways too.

99
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,575
Through a pose estimation model,

100
00:05:00,575 --> 00:05:03,530
a Google AI experiment called Move Mirror matches

101
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:05,630
your real-time movements to hundreds of images of

102
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:08,450
people doing similar poses from around the world.

103
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:11,375
Feel free to try it out yourself and have some fun and get inspired.

104
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:14,390
Then tune back into this course and learn how image classification models

105
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:18,990
extract features from those images and how you can make the magic happen.
