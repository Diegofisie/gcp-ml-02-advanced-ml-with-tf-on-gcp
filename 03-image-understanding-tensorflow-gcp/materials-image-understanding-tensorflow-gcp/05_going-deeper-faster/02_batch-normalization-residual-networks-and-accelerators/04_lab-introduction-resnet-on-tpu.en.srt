1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,270
The code that was submitted for Stanford DAWN benchmark is open source,

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,475
and it's readily available on GitHub.

3
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:11,110
In the optional lab that follows,

4
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:15,435
you can try training the ResNet model on your own data.

5
00:00:15,435 --> 00:00:21,545
You will start with a dataset of JPEG images each of which has been labeled.

6
00:00:21,545 --> 00:00:26,185
You will then convert the JPEG images to TensorFlow records.

7
00:00:26,185 --> 00:00:30,885
This is particularly important for the TPU because otherwise,

8
00:00:30,885 --> 00:00:33,515
the TPU will waste its time waiting for

9
00:00:33,515 --> 00:00:36,485
inputs to be processed and read into the pipeline.

10
00:00:36,485 --> 00:00:38,385
When you're using TPUs,

11
00:00:38,385 --> 00:00:41,600
you want to read data the fastest possible way.

12
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,295
So, it's worth converting the images into TF records first.

13
00:00:46,295 --> 00:00:48,280
Once you have the TF records,

14
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,475
you will run a cloud ML Engine job,

15
00:00:50,475 --> 00:00:53,675
specifying the scale tier to be BASIC_TPU.

16
00:00:53,675 --> 00:00:56,725
The lab is optional.

17
00:00:56,725 --> 00:01:02,070
Why is it optional? Because you have to do it in your own Google Cloud account.

18
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,865
You cannot do it on Qwiklabs labs because of

19
00:01:04,865 --> 00:01:08,785
technical difficulties today around getting TPU quarter.

20
00:01:08,785 --> 00:01:11,990
The total cost to do this lab on Google Cloud,

21
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:13,610
if you decide to do it in your account,

22
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:15,275
it's about three dollars,

23
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:16,970
but the lab is optional.

24
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:18,590
It doesn't involve any coding.

25
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:21,740
It's just a question of running several scripts.

26
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,205
So, I'll walk through it,

27
00:01:23,205 --> 00:01:26,100
so you could just wait for the debrief.
