1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,695
In the previous section,

2
00:00:01,695 --> 00:00:05,710
we reviewed strategies that are appropriate when you have some labeled data already.

3
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:09,675
But what if your data don't have labels or you don't have any data at all?

4
00:00:09,675 --> 00:00:12,135
Don't worry, you still have options.

5
00:00:12,135 --> 00:00:14,050
If you don't have any data at all,

6
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:15,790
you can use a pre-trained model.

7
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:20,650
Of course, you need to find a model trained on a task that's close enough to match yours.

8
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:22,945
Google has machine learning APIs,

9
00:00:22,945 --> 00:00:26,120
where all we need to do is make an API call with your picture.

10
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:30,500
The Vision API can classify pictures from one of thousands of categories,

11
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,295
but can also do a lot more.

12
00:00:32,295 --> 00:00:35,135
It can do OCR, Optical Character Recognition,

13
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:37,090
it can recognize unsafe content,

14
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,815
and it can even be used to create a visual product similarity search engine.

15
00:00:40,815 --> 00:00:42,990
Google Cloud's Vision API is one of

16
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:45,385
the pre-trained models you will experiment with later.

17
00:00:45,385 --> 00:00:48,450
Again, you don't need to bring your own image data for training,

18
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,615
the model is pre-trained.

19
00:00:50,615 --> 00:00:53,870
The Vision API also improves over time as

20
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:56,955
new concepts are introduced and accuracy is improved.

21
00:00:56,955 --> 00:01:00,420
Want to create a custom image model with no code whatsoever?

22
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,425
With AutoML vision, you can create custom models

23
00:01:03,425 --> 00:01:06,920
without any code that highlights specific concepts of your images.

24
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,590
You'll practice with both the Cloud Vision API and Cloud AutoML in a later module.

25
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:14,260
The other thing you can do is get more data.

26
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:17,120
There are companies that label data as a service and

27
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:21,185
Google Cloud is partnering with Figure Eight to bring that service to GCP customers.

28
00:01:21,185 --> 00:01:24,270
For more information, check out the link that we provide.

29
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:28,510
There you have it. Even though data scarcity is a very real challenge,

30
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:30,725
we have plenty of tools to address it.

31
00:01:30,725 --> 00:01:31,955
If we have some data,

32
00:01:31,955 --> 00:01:35,470
we can take our data and make more of it using data augmentation,

33
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:38,900
or we can decrease our need for data by using transfer

34
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:43,890
learning and even if you wanna do transfer learning without writing any code, you can.

35
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,100
If you don't have any labeled data,

36
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:50,375
you can still use state of the art models for a variety of computer vision tasks,

37
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:53,920
or you can enlist a partner to help you label your data.
