00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:04,485
Welcome to the last module of the image classification course.

2
00:00:04,485 --> 00:00:08,675
Now that you have built your own image classifiers using linear,

3
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:11,335
DNN and CNN models with TensorFlow,

4
00:00:11,335 --> 00:00:14,470
it's time to experiment with pre-built image models.

5
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:17,805
In most cases, you will want to try these before

6
00:00:17,805 --> 00:00:21,950
investing your time in developing custom TensorFlow code for a model.

7
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:24,900
This module, we'll start with a brief overview of

8
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,045
the different pre-built models available from Google.

9
00:00:28,045 --> 00:00:32,385
You will also see examples of popular business applications of each.

10
00:00:32,385 --> 00:00:37,920
You'll start by reviewing the spectrum of ML options on Google Cloud platform,

11
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,880
with a focus on the pre-built and pre-trained models for image classification.

12
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,320
With Cloud ML Vision API,

13
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:50,135
you will classify images without even having to provide a training images dataset.

14
00:00:50,135 --> 00:00:55,775
The API relies on Google's pre-trained model you can use directly from browser.

15
00:00:55,775 --> 00:00:59,555
Next, you will move on to AutoML service,

16
00:00:59,555 --> 00:01:02,635
which allows you to get state of the art image classification results from

17
00:01:02,635 --> 00:01:07,355
models trained with your own custom labels and your own image dataset.

18
00:01:07,355 --> 00:01:09,740
You will see a demo of the service and then

19
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:13,970
compare AutoML and the Vision API in the upcoming lab.
