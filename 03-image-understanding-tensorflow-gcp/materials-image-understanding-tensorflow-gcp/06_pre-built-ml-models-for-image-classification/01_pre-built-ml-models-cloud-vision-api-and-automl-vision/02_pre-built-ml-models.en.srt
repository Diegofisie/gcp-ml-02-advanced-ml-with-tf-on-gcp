1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,680
It takes so much work to keep up with advances in machine learning and AI,

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,230
because both are rapidly evolving fields of study and practice.

3
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:10,120
By the time you watch this recording,

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:14,085
chances are there is a new ML model available for training out there in the world.

5
00:00:14,085 --> 00:00:18,060
So, it's worthwhile to understand the entire spectrum of

6
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,080
a ML tools available on Google Cloud platform at the time of this recording,

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,840
and better understand who should use which tools.

8
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:31,665
Here's, the spectrum of a ML tools on GCP that you as a data scientist,

9
00:00:31,665 --> 00:00:33,710
or as a data practitioner should know.

10
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:35,340
On the left-side, are

11
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,920
the TensorFlow models that you have been building so far in this course.

12
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:43,250
You've already got experience building custom CNN's in your last lab.

13
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,915
On the far right-side of the diagram,

14
00:00:45,915 --> 00:00:48,150
is machine learning with AutoML.

15
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:50,135
Remember that with AutoML,

16
00:00:50,135 --> 00:00:52,070
there's zero code for you to write.

17
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:55,550
Let's walk through each of these options in more detail.

18
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:59,420
You've already got plenty of experience building TensorFlow models,

19
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:03,550
like the one in the end-to-end lab you did at the start of the specialization.

20
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:08,185
The code from the lab should be a go-to library for customer ML models.

21
00:01:08,185 --> 00:01:12,830
But it's not the only tool you should keep in mind for yourself, or for your team.

22
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:18,635
BigQuery is a fast serverless data warehousing platform on GCP.

23
00:01:18,635 --> 00:01:23,795
Did you know that it has a machine learning feature aimed at data analysts?

24
00:01:23,795 --> 00:01:27,680
BigQuery ML models can be built using regular SQL,

25
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,225
and are created and stored right where your data already lives, in BigQuery.

26
00:01:32,225 --> 00:01:36,350
It's a great starting place for building quick, batch prediction linear,

27
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:41,245
and logistic regression models to check if your data is a good fit for ML.

28
00:01:41,245 --> 00:01:45,525
BigQuery machine learning models are built on structured data sets.

29
00:01:45,525 --> 00:01:48,885
So, don't count on them to help with image classification.

30
00:01:48,885 --> 00:01:53,770
But if you, or data analysts on your team work with structured data,

31
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:56,845
you should give BigQuery ML a closer look.

32
00:01:56,845 --> 00:02:01,275
Next is a suite of pre-trained ML APIs.

33
00:02:01,275 --> 00:02:06,840
Here, pre-trained means you don't even need to have a label training dataset to use them.

34
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,655
These APIs like the Vision API,

35
00:02:09,655 --> 00:02:11,520
or the natural language processing,

36
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:17,000
translation, already trained for common ML use cases like image classification.

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,650
They save you the time and effort of building,

38
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:21,965
curating and training a new dataset,

39
00:02:21,965 --> 00:02:25,275
so you can just jump ahead right to predictions.

40
00:02:25,275 --> 00:02:30,665
For pre-trained models, Google has already figured out a lot of the hard problems.

41
00:02:30,665 --> 00:02:34,190
Vision API is based on Google's image datasets.

42
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:37,545
Speech API is trained on YouTube captions.

43
00:02:37,545 --> 00:02:43,084
Machine Translation API is built on parallel texts for language translations.

44
00:02:43,084 --> 00:02:46,780
Recall that how well your model is strained,

45
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:49,265
depends on how much data you have.

46
00:02:49,265 --> 00:02:52,765
As you would expect, Google has a lot of images,

47
00:02:52,765 --> 00:02:55,970
text, and ML researchers to train its pre-built bottles.

48
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:59,910
So, you can use those instead of reinventing the wheel.

49
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:03,530
For example, if you're looking to have captions

50
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:06,555
included in a recent webinar hosted by accompany,

51
00:03:06,555 --> 00:03:09,350
consider using the translate a speech APIs

52
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:13,500
instead of trying to build a language recognition ML model yourself.

53
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,425
Another example, if you have text documents

54
00:03:17,425 --> 00:03:21,320
like expense receipts that you need classified by expense type,

55
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,890
consider using the Cloud Vision APIs for OCR,

56
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:30,715
so we can mine the text from the receipts and drop the data into something like BigQuery.

57
00:03:30,715 --> 00:03:36,230
In your next lab, you will be invoking these APIs for the Cloud Shell console.

58
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:40,445
It should be no surprise that these APIs make ML look easy.

59
00:03:40,445 --> 00:03:44,245
The AutoML platform you saw earlier is all about

60
00:03:44,245 --> 00:03:47,590
cordless transfer learning was AutoML vision,

61
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:50,710
you upload or link your images training dataset,

62
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,170
and with a click of a button,

63
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:56,180
AutoML trains a high-performance custom image classification model,

64
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,915
that's ready for evaluation and prediction.

65
00:03:58,915 --> 00:04:04,105
The platform also provides direct integration with Google's human labeling program.

66
00:04:04,105 --> 00:04:07,595
So, in cases where you have images with no labels,

67
00:04:07,595 --> 00:04:10,910
Google will provide you with access to an in-house team of

68
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:15,500
human labelers that will classify your images based on your instructions.

69
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:22,490
These are the same teams as Google uses for its own ML APIs and other ML products.

70
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:26,210
Here are just a few customer examples of companies who have used

71
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:29,780
the ML tools on Google Cloud Platform on their datasets.

72
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:32,315
As you review them from left to right,

73
00:04:32,315 --> 00:04:35,330
note that the examples tell about the journey from

74
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:40,370
low-level programming to more abstraction and UI based ML training.

75
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:43,880
AUCNET built their own custom model to

76
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,640
classify images of car parts and estimate their price.

77
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,840
Ocado used passed results from

78
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:57,295
the ML APIs to route customer emails to the appropriate customer service representatives.

79
00:04:57,295 --> 00:05:03,465
GIPHY uses the out-of-the-box vision APIs to find the text and memes,

80
00:05:03,465 --> 00:05:05,935
using optical character recognition.

81
00:05:05,935 --> 00:05:11,850
It then can reject inappropriate uploads based on sentiment or keywords.

82
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:17,760
UNIQLO designed a shopping chatbot using dialogue flow UI.

83
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,050
Dialogflow, is a Google owned company which

84
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:25,890
specializes in building ML based interfaces like intelligent chatbots.

85
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:30,790
I'll provide a link to where you can watch more customer stories as well.
