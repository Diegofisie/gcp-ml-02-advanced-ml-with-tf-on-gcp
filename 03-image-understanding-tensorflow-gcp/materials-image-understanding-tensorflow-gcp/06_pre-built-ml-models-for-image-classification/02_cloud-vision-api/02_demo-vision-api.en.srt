1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,705
Okay. So, let's go ahead and try out Vision API in this lab.

2
00:00:04,705 --> 00:00:09,905
As you can see, here I'm logged into cloud.google.com/vision,

3
00:00:09,905 --> 00:00:13,780
and this is where I can access the APIs directly from the browser.

4
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,985
As I scroll down further in the page,

5
00:00:15,985 --> 00:00:20,595
notice that there's a box where you can try the API by dragging an image,

6
00:00:20,595 --> 00:00:25,315
and I have already prepared a file that contains a cloud image in it.

7
00:00:25,315 --> 00:00:26,855
So, as you recall,

8
00:00:26,855 --> 00:00:30,530
the problem statement was to check if an image contains a cloud.

9
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:34,175
In this case, once I've uploaded the file,

10
00:00:34,175 --> 00:00:38,755
the cloud was recognized with 99 percent accuracy.

11
00:00:38,755 --> 00:00:41,990
So, that's great, but this was an easy problem.

12
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:48,240
Let's make it harder. Now, it's time to try the web browser version of the API yourself.

13
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,900
I'll provide these free images for you,

14
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,875
but feel free to experiment and provide your own.

15
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:57,945
Head to cloud.google.com/vision.

16
00:00:57,945 --> 00:00:59,780
Try the Vision API,

17
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:03,070
and then come back to the lesson when you're done.
