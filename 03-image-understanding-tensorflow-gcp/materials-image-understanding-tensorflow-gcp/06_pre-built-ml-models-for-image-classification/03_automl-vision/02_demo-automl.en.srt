00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,495
This is a demo of the AutoML Vision API interface.

2
00:00:05,495 --> 00:00:09,500
This is what we'd want to use when Vision API is not correct enough,

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,820
so we want to get more specific on our labels.

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,535
The first thing we would do is import our training images

5
00:00:14,535 --> 00:00:18,750
from Google Cloud Storage as well as labels to those images.

6
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,800
When we click over on the Label tab,

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,430
we can do several other things like define labels.

8
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,985
Clicking into that, what we see are five labels for clouds as you see here,

9
00:00:27,985 --> 00:00:32,190
altocumulus, altostratus, cirrus, cumulonimbus and cumulus.

10
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:37,985
These green numbers indicate how many examples we have in this labels.

11
00:00:37,985 --> 00:00:44,570
We can also review our image labels by actually viewing the images.

12
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:50,100
So, we'll get a display of images when you mouse over them and click through,

13
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,865
we get what that label is what that images.

14
00:00:52,865 --> 00:00:56,930
We could change the image label by using the radio buttons,

15
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:02,405
we can also exclude or choose an image as an example of a particular label.

16
00:01:02,405 --> 00:01:04,630
Once we click out of this,

17
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:06,900
we also have different options for labels.

18
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,160
So, for instance, if we didn't have labels on these,

19
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,875
we could use Google's human labeling service for labeling more images.

20
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:17,125
This is the labeling service that Google uses internally to also

21
00:01:17,125 --> 00:01:21,530
label for other images that we use.

22
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:27,650
So, this is unlike humans who have to in a process that they go through to evaluate.

23
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:29,355
So, to be able to train,

24
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:34,300
this is where we'd go to train a nude Auto ML vision model.

25
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,285
We could choose between the base and advanced models,

26
00:01:37,285 --> 00:01:40,185
once you select base or advanced,

27
00:01:40,185 --> 00:01:42,485
you click Change, and that will change the model.

28
00:01:42,485 --> 00:01:43,990
We've trained two models.

29
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:46,190
So, we're going to go over to the Evaluate tab.

30
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:50,810
In evaluate, we see that we have a model already selected the advanced,

31
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,830
and we can click through a few different measures,

32
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:57,000
you see confidence threshold curves and as well as the confusion matrix.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,210
The confusion matrix has an each cell

34
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:05,040
those which have been classified correctly versus those which have been mis-classified,

35
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,485
confusion matrix has those labels or those images classified correctly on the diagonal.

36
00:02:10,485 --> 00:02:13,280
In this case, we see that for altocumulus,

37
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,665
16 out of 21 have been labeled correctly.

38
00:02:16,665 --> 00:02:19,490
We can also go to the top of this and compare this,

39
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:24,940
model this advanced model to our base model which we've already trained here.

40
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,580
When we do that,

41
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:30,440
our confusion matrix gives us a really nifty view where it

42
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:34,970
presents the percent improvement from the base model.

43
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:38,005
So, in this case, altocumulus gains 23 percent,

44
00:02:38,005 --> 00:02:43,485
cumulus 11, cirrus 26, cumulonimbus six.

45
00:02:43,485 --> 00:02:48,745
We actually lose a bit of predictive accuracy for altrostratus however.

46
00:02:48,745 --> 00:02:55,020
We can also click into one of these cells to see where the errors happen.

47
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,380
In this case, on the lower left of the confusion matrix,

48
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,720
these are false negatives.

49
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:07,690
So, these are things which have been labeled or are in fact altostratus.

50
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:10,500
Going back to the top,

51
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,150
we clicked over to actually predicting with this model.

52
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:16,275
Once we've clicked into this,

53
00:03:16,275 --> 00:03:18,940
we can go ahead and upload a model by clicking Query

54
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:22,040
online and choosing a local file to predict.

55
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,120
This case, I'll choose a file that comes

56
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,215
from a image that we haven't seen in our training.

57
00:03:29,215 --> 00:03:34,370
Click Predict, and it takes a second do the prediction,

58
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,020
and once we have that,

59
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:49,440
what we should get is the percent confidence we have that this image matches the label.

60
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:55,810
So, in this case, we are 0.99 percent sure that this is a cirrus,

61
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:58,130
less sure about cumulus and altocumulus.

62
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:00,270
Also clicking onto the Vision API,

63
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:06,320
we see the actual commands that you would use to do this in the cloud shell,

64
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,835
and if we were using a request,

65
00:04:08,835 --> 00:04:12,350
just on the request file we'd see what that structure of that file looks like,

66
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:14,885
so that takes the URL, also takes that.

67
00:04:14,885 --> 00:04:16,650
The features we want to use is

68
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:21,180
custom label detection and also which model we want to use here,

69
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:24,180
in this case, we want to use the advanced model.

70
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:28,640
So that's it, that's how we predict with AutoML.

71
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:32,650
I'm looking forward to having you play with it in the lab.
