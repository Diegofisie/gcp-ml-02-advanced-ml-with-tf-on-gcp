1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,070
In this lab, you will experiment with pre-built models,

2
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:05,490
so there's no coding.

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:09,000
First, we'll start with the pre-trained Vision API,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,870
where we don't need to bring our own data,

5
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:16,900
and then we'll progress into AutoML for more sophisticated custom labeling that we need.

6
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:20,775
In this pre-built ML lab for image classification,

7
00:00:20,775 --> 00:00:24,235
you will set up an API key for ML Vision API,

8
00:00:24,235 --> 00:00:28,290
invoke the pre-trained ML Vision API to classify images,

9
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:31,285
review label predictions from Vision API,

10
00:00:31,285 --> 00:00:36,105
train and evaluate a customer Auto ML vision image classification model

11
00:00:36,105 --> 00:00:39,960
and predict with Auto ML on new images.
