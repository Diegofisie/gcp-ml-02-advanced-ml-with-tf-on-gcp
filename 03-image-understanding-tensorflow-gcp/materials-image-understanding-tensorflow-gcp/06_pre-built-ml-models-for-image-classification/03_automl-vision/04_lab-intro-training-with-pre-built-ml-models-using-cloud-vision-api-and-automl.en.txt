In this lab, you will experiment with pre-built models, so there's no coding. First, we'll start with the pre-trained Vision API, where we don't need to bring our own data, and then we'll progress into AutoML for more sophisticated custom labeling that we need. In this pre-built ML lab for image classification, you will set up an API key for ML Vision API, invoke the pre-trained ML Vision API to classify images, review label predictions from Vision API, train and evaluate a customer Auto ML vision image classification model and predict with Auto ML on new images.
