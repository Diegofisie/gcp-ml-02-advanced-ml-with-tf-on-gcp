1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,855
Okay. Welcome to using the Cloud Vision API.

2
00:00:02,855 --> 00:00:05,010
We're going to go through the lab using

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:09,155
the Cloud Vision API on a real example and show you how to do that.

4
00:00:09,155 --> 00:00:12,630
So, you should already have platform setup.

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,440
The first thing you're going to do is,

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,760
you're going to go ahead and create an API key.

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,775
So, you're going to go ahead and click the Navigation menu,

8
00:00:19,775 --> 00:00:23,035
go to APIs and Services and click Credentials.

9
00:00:23,035 --> 00:00:26,480
There, we already have an API key setup,

10
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,240
we're going to go ahead and create another one.

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,045
You want to go to click Create Credentials,

12
00:00:31,045 --> 00:00:34,745
API key, and you'll get an API key here.

13
00:00:34,745 --> 00:00:36,075
We don't want to restrict it all,

14
00:00:36,075 --> 00:00:37,745
we'll first press Close.

15
00:00:37,745 --> 00:00:41,415
Okay. Then we're going to go ahead and copy that,

16
00:00:41,415 --> 00:00:44,840
you'll copy API key 2.

17
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,360
You want to open up to the cloud shell so,

18
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,560
we'll go ahead and open up an instance of the Cloud Shell,

19
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,230
and what we want to do is,

20
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:56,580
we want to assign environment variable there.

21
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:08,995
So, we're going to go ahead and type export API_KEY equals that API key.

22
00:01:08,995 --> 00:01:14,135
Okay. So now, API key is stored as an environment variable and Cloud Shell.

23
00:01:14,135 --> 00:01:15,920
Next thing we're going to do is,

24
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,490
we're going to go ahead and create a storage bucket on cloud storage.

25
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:23,180
So, we'll go ahead to our navigation menu,

26
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:25,710
go down to Cloud Storage.

27
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,860
Okay. We already have a bucket you created with

28
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:30,160
our project name, I'm going to click through there.

29
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,050
Then what I'm going to do is I'm going to upload a file,

30
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:37,910
and the file is going to be the image that I want to use Vision API on.

31
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:42,670
So, I'm going to go ahead and click Upload and I have my image on the cloud here.

32
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:46,275
So, I'm going to go ahead and upload that file with the dialog,

33
00:01:46,275 --> 00:01:51,300
I'll finish, and we had to make sure that this is a public file.

34
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,070
So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to click this Settings menu,

35
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:57,490
I'm going to scroll down to edit permissions,

36
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,400
and then I'm going to click Add item,

37
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:04,050
select user, and for name,

38
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:05,310
I'm going to type all,

39
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:09,465
and then Users with the U capital and camel case,

40
00:02:09,465 --> 00:02:12,080
and then for a reader that's the accessible.

41
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,515
I'll save this, and now,

42
00:02:14,515 --> 00:02:16,280
they'll show that this image is pumped.

43
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm going to click this image over here.

44
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,910
So, we can see what that image is.

45
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,685
It's a picture of cirrus clouds,

46
00:02:26,685 --> 00:02:31,080
wispy, as distinct from other types of clouds.

47
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,410
We'll get into that in a second.

48
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:40,910
Next from there, we're going to go ahead and we're going to create a Vision API requests.

49
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:48,115
The way we do that, is by creating a request.json file and in that,

50
00:02:48,115 --> 00:02:51,620
we're going to indicate where the image is located.

51
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:56,470
Also, what part of the Vision API we're going to use.

52
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:59,230
We're going to go ahead and click this pencil,

53
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:01,930
and that's going to bring up the Cloud Editor.

54
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:05,860
Okay. In the Cloud at Cloud Shell Editor,

55
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,480
we already have of how we're going to use in a second.

56
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,965
We're going to click on this request.json file,

57
00:03:10,965 --> 00:03:14,865
and here, we have our request.json file.

58
00:03:14,865 --> 00:03:18,395
You'll see as json files are structured,

59
00:03:18,395 --> 00:03:23,635
this is a dictionary Nesson with multiple Items and here we have requests.

60
00:03:23,635 --> 00:03:27,430
Within requests, we have image then source,

61
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,920
then where our image's located?

62
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,905
So, in this case, the bucket and then the file name.

63
00:03:32,905 --> 00:03:34,800
We also have our features.

64
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,125
In this case, we want to do label detection,

65
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:42,745
we want to detect which items are in the particular image,

66
00:03:42,745 --> 00:03:44,935
and we're going to say maxResults 10.

67
00:03:44,935 --> 00:03:48,655
Okay. From there, we're going to go back to our Cloud Shell,

68
00:03:48,655 --> 00:03:52,535
and we're going to use the crop command to make that request.

69
00:03:52,535 --> 00:03:54,135
Okay, this is an API.

70
00:03:54,135 --> 00:03:59,125
So, we can make that request with our API key,

71
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:01,460
and then we'll paste that.

72
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:04,330
I'm going to make this Cloud Shell bit bigger,

73
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:05,970
so we can see what's happening here.

74
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:10,145
So, label and annotations have four items, the MID.

75
00:04:10,145 --> 00:04:12,705
This is the ID and the Google knowledge graph.

76
00:04:12,705 --> 00:04:17,360
There's also a description of what the image contains,

77
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:22,680
in this case sky, and a score and topicality which indicates some accuracy metric.

78
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,625
So, we have the sky here, blue,

79
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:31,565
daytime, center number four and this's the list that we use to cloud,

80
00:04:31,565 --> 00:04:33,275
we also got atmosphere,

81
00:04:33,275 --> 00:04:35,240
Cumulus, which is curious,

82
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,625
we'll come back to that in a second,

83
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:43,735
Azure, calm, meteorological phenomenon and computer wallpaper, which is funny.

84
00:04:43,735 --> 00:04:46,930
So, focusing on cumulus,

85
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:50,190
this actually funny that this is labelled as stimulus,

86
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:54,125
because if you're familiar with meteorology at all,

87
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:56,450
this is actually a cirrus cloud.

88
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:59,780
If we look at what cumulus clouds look like in Google image search,

89
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,840
they come up as those big fluffy clouds,

90
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,040
clouds that look like there may be a storm on the horizon,

91
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,190
but also clouds that look peaceful.

92
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:11,480
But that's not we're getting here. So, this seems to

93
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,020
indicate that we need some finer granularity and

94
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:17,240
finer control for our cloud classification.

95
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,690
There's other cool things that we can do in Vision API including our Web Detection,

96
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:24,775
and once you do that on your own, play with that.

97
00:05:24,775 --> 00:05:27,920
That references what you see if you search,

98
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,665
it's like a Google reverse image search which is pretty cool.

99
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:34,295
Right now, what we're going to do is focus on

100
00:05:34,295 --> 00:05:37,695
the power we can leverage using our auto-Elmo framework.

101
00:05:37,695 --> 00:05:44,410
Okay. So, what we're going to do first is we're going to go back to our shell,

102
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:55,630
we're going to go back to our home screen over here on the Google Cloud Platform console,

103
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:59,060
and we're going to go ahead and click this link,

104
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:03,190
you should have this link that's going to set up, our AutoML UI.

105
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:05,610
So, when you click go to this link,

106
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:08,240
what you will probably get is

107
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,520
something that tells you to go to billing or set up the API,

108
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,990
you want to click setup now,

109
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:14,760
the big blue button there,

110
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:19,550
and then after you click this,

111
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:27,350
if you navigate over to your Google Cloud Platform dashboard and go to storage,

112
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:30,860
you will notice there's a new bucket that is created.

113
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:36,890
What you'll see is you'll see a new bucket with name and it ends with VCM.

114
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:38,175
Okay. This is your new bucket,

115
00:06:38,175 --> 00:06:42,480
and this is where the Vision API is going to work from.

116
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,885
Okay. You want to copy that bucket name.

117
00:06:44,885 --> 00:06:46,895
We're going to go back to our Cloud Shell.

118
00:06:46,895 --> 00:06:49,400
We're going to go ahead and we are going to

119
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,240
export that bucket name as an environment variable.

120
00:06:53,240 --> 00:07:00,135
Okay. So, we have that bucket name Environment variable.

121
00:07:00,135 --> 00:07:03,050
The next thing I'm going to do is you're going to go ahead and use

122
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:07,805
the gsutil command and you're going to copy the training images into your bucket.

123
00:07:07,805 --> 00:07:09,550
So, we're going to copy this,

124
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:11,720
we're not going to run it because we've already copied

125
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,545
the images beforehand for time's sake.

126
00:07:15,545 --> 00:07:19,155
I'll take about a minute or two to run that.

127
00:07:19,155 --> 00:07:23,550
Once you've done that, you can click refresh on your browser.

128
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:25,290
Once you go into this bucket,

129
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:27,985
you should see three folders.

130
00:07:27,985 --> 00:07:34,525
In this case, we have four folders but there's three.

131
00:07:34,525 --> 00:07:38,100
So, it's cirrus, cumulonimbus and cumulus.

132
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:42,285
This clouds folder is our model which we'll talk about in a second.

133
00:07:42,285 --> 00:07:46,605
Okay. So, after that we're going to go ahead and create our dataset.

134
00:07:46,605 --> 00:07:53,200
The way we are going to create our dataset is by copying over our data file

135
00:07:53,200 --> 00:08:00,405
which indicates where each image is located as well as the label for it.

136
00:08:00,405 --> 00:08:06,830
We'll go ahead and use gsutil which will copy over a data.csv file.

137
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:11,340
So, I'm going to go ahead and run this.

138
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:15,340
What I'll do is we can use less to look at this file.

139
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:19,685
What that contains a Google Cloud Storage URL

140
00:08:19,685 --> 00:08:22,750
with placeholder and then the name of the file and then the labels.

141
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,535
So, in this case we have cirrus,

142
00:08:24,535 --> 00:08:29,285
then going down more we have cumulonimbus and lastly cumulus.

143
00:08:29,285 --> 00:08:32,560
I will go ahead and use the send command to replace

144
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:37,800
all instances of the word placeholder with the name of the bucket,

145
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:42,470
and then we'll look at that file again with less and we see

146
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:46,030
that place holder has been replaced with the name of

147
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:50,110
our Auto ML bucket and then what we'll do is we'll upload

148
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:56,600
that file using gsutil up to our Cloud Storage Bucket.

149
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:04,270
So, then when we go back if we click refresh on this bucket and we scroll down,

150
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:08,470
we'll see that we have a data.csv file.

151
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:12,595
So, we'll go ahead and we scroll down we see that there's a data file.

152
00:09:12,595 --> 00:09:14,765
Cool. All right.

153
00:09:14,765 --> 00:09:18,125
So, now we can actually go ahead and get started and train this model.

154
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:24,020
So, I'm going to navigate back to my Auto ML UI and what you should see,

155
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:27,275
you'll use our blue boxes as critical as a model,

156
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:30,105
but you also see a button that says new dataset.

157
00:09:30,105 --> 00:09:34,230
So, you're going to want to click New Dataset and what that's going to give you,

158
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:36,690
is this kind of prompt you for a data set name,

159
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:38,300
we'll call it clouds we're not going to actually

160
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,470
create this dataset since we already have one.

161
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:42,960
I'll give you some options for import.

162
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,850
So I'll say import, and upload images from your computer,

163
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:48,470
you can also select a CSV file from

164
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:51,720
Cloud Storage that points to your paths and also has labels.

165
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,090
In this case this is what we'd want to do,

166
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:56,005
so we type data.csv.

167
00:09:56,005 --> 00:09:58,375
You can also import your images later.

168
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:02,325
Lastly, you have the option to use multi-label classification.

169
00:10:02,325 --> 00:10:04,170
That's a case where if we want to put

170
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:08,220
multiple labels on a single image that's what we want to do,

171
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,210
we're just looking at one label per image in

172
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:13,230
this case and after that you click Create Dataset.

173
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:14,820
We've already created a data set.

174
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:20,685
So, I'm going to click cancel here and then we have our dataset we've already created.

175
00:10:20,685 --> 00:10:22,930
So I'm going to go ahead and click into that.

176
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:28,895
From there, we're going to get a really cool interface which gives us all our images.

177
00:10:28,895 --> 00:10:30,610
Under each of these images,

178
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,950
is a label in this case are cumulus clouds.

179
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:34,860
When you scroll down, you'll also see

180
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:39,100
our cumulus nimbus clouds and then we can also see our cirrus clouds.

181
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,660
You can also filter here by clicking the labels on

182
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:44,490
the side and we'll see only our cumulus clouds,

183
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:48,560
only our cirrus clouds et cetera okay.

184
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:53,295
Lastly, to train the model we're going to go ahead and click Train.

185
00:10:53,295 --> 00:10:58,370
When you click train, that's going to give you an option to train a new model.

186
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:03,615
So, I'm going to click train new model and what that'll give me is a model name.

187
00:11:03,615 --> 00:11:08,145
Usually this has a timestamp here, our training budget.

188
00:11:08,145 --> 00:11:12,400
In this case on a real GSB instance,

189
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:16,180
it will give you a option to do one compute

190
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:20,205
error or to charge it to an account and also a data summary.

191
00:11:20,205 --> 00:11:23,540
Okay. Then you click start training to create a new model.

192
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,690
That takes about 15 minutes to do, so no,

193
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:28,170
we're not going to do it here, so I'm going to cancel out this,

194
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:30,495
but I'm going to look into the model that we actually got.

195
00:11:30,495 --> 00:11:32,820
I'm going to see our full evaluation.

196
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:38,395
Okay. So I look into this model and see how our training did,

197
00:11:38,395 --> 00:11:39,790
we have 60 images,

198
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:42,300
our average position is perfect and there's

199
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,380
actually perfect precision here and it's pretty amazing.

200
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:53,885
So in this case, our recall and our precision is quite good at this point.

201
00:11:53,885 --> 00:11:57,025
In this case our threshold is set at 50,

202
00:11:57,025 --> 00:11:58,660
but you can also change this.

203
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:01,710
So for instance if I move my score threshold to 0.75,

204
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:04,275
our recall goes down, I move it over here,

205
00:12:04,275 --> 00:12:05,530
our precision goes down.

206
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:07,560
Typically, we want to balance both precision

207
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,720
and recall but it depends on what your task is.

208
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,945
From there, we can also scroll all the way down,

209
00:12:13,945 --> 00:12:16,825
we can see a confusion matrix and so there was absolutely no confusion,

210
00:12:16,825 --> 00:12:18,820
we have 100% on the diurnal.

211
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,625
Good job. So it looks like we did pretty good job here.

212
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:29,200
Lastly, what we can do is that we can test our Auto ML on some new images.

213
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,735
Okay. So, let's go ahead and go to predict.

214
00:12:33,735 --> 00:12:36,845
So, let's go ahead and upload an image.

215
00:12:36,845 --> 00:12:39,375
In this case we're going to upload that image that we tried before,

216
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:42,685
that cirrus cloud that we tried to classify before.

217
00:12:42,685 --> 00:12:47,020
We're going to upload that and then we're going to go ahead and lo and behold,

218
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:51,780
we get perfect prediction for this cirrus cloud which is pretty amazing.

219
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:56,250
You can try going ahead and classifying another cloud.

220
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,320
I'm going to go ahead and click "Upload Images" and

221
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:03,445
I created this new file test2 it's a cumulonimbus.

222
00:13:03,445 --> 00:13:07,500
So, I'm going to upload that and we have

223
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:12,750
this big cloud big fluffy cloud and [inaudible] we have a cumulonimbus cloud. That's pretty cool.

224
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:16,760
So, the difference between the Auto ML model

225
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:22,735
and the Vision API you are not supplying any data or any labels,

226
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:28,935
Vision API is using the models that is trained itself within Google,

227
00:13:28,935 --> 00:13:33,980
and within Auto ML you bring your own data and you bring your own labels,

228
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:37,950
and from there you can create a model from there.

229
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:41,260
Pretty cool. Using both this tool inside of

230
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:44,260
Vision API where you didn't have to bring any data or

231
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:50,625
any labels and the API was able to do multiple classifications on a single image,

232
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:55,500
and also using Auto ML where you brought your own data and you brought own labels and

233
00:13:55,500 --> 00:14:00,955
using Google's classifiers and deep learning models,

234
00:14:00,955 --> 00:14:05,610
it was able to develop a model and do prediction on that model.

235
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:07,275
So, hope you enjoyed this lab,

236
00:14:07,275 --> 00:14:09,840
you can do this lab as many times if you want.

237
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:14,695
If you want to collect your own images and play around with the Auto ML models or

238
00:14:14,695 --> 00:14:17,200
go ahead and try to throw

239
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:21,255
all kinds of different models at Vision API, we encourages you to.

240
00:14:21,255 --> 00:14:23,265
Sky's the limit here.

241
00:14:23,265 --> 00:14:27,730
No pun intended that we're using clouds but, I hope you had fun.
