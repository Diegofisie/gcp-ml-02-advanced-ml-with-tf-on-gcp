1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,635
Now, it's time for you to create your first chatbot using Dialogflow.

2
00:00:07,635 --> 00:00:14,105
In this lab, you will familiarize yourself with Dialogflow console,

3
00:00:14,105 --> 00:00:17,400
learn to create intents,

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,880
extract data with entities,

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,435
manage state with contexts,

6
00:00:24,435 --> 00:00:27,735
and tests the chatbot.

7
00:00:27,735 --> 00:00:34,045
Don't forget, you have multiple attempt to start and stop each lab.

8
00:00:34,045 --> 00:00:39,650
So, don't worry, if you don't make it through on the first time.

9
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:41,860
Also, as a tip,

10
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:45,470
you can take a second attempt at the lab,

11
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:54,080
if you just wanted to experiment with a code before watching the solution video later.
