1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:08,100
We have look at the tensor2tensor and language translation.

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:13,730
This is fine if we need to simply do one thing.

3
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:23,210
What about having an automatic way of training for conversational system such as Chatbot?

4
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:29,840
Training separate models using tensor2tensor or

5
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:38,530
AutoML for each question answer pair is very cumbersome.

6
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:44,150
It is much better if we could take advantage of

7
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:52,690
preexisting natural language technologies that let us build conversations.

8
00:00:52,690 --> 00:01:00,400
Not one question to one answer but the entire conversations.

9
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:07,855
Dialogflow is an end to end developer platform for building

10
00:01:07,855 --> 00:01:12,290
rich conversational experiences that people

11
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:18,005
can communicate with naturally and efficiently.

12
00:01:18,005 --> 00:01:22,990
It picks up the best answer among

13
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:30,920
all possible answers through intent and entity classifications.

14
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:38,320
There are three components in Dialogflow,

15
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:44,710
intents, entity and contexts.

16
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:52,120
Intents are the action a user wants to execute.

17
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:58,010
They represent a mapping between what the user says

18
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:04,935
and what action should be taken by a chatbot.

19
00:02:04,935 --> 00:02:10,650
In communication, intents can be sort of as

20
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:19,410
the root verbs in the dialogue such as the verb order in the sentence,

21
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:22,495
"I will like to order to two coffees."

22
00:02:22,495 --> 00:02:28,445
Sometimes the intents are not explicit but

23
00:02:28,445 --> 00:02:35,815
instead are inferred from the entire composition of a phrase.

24
00:02:35,815 --> 00:02:40,930
For example, in two coffees please,

25
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:49,890
the intent is the verb order even though it has not been explicitly said.

26
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:59,150
We also want to map out intents to the goal of our application.

27
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:04,190
If we are building a helpdesk application then

28
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:11,530
our intents might include the obvious intent of opening a ticket,

29
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:16,570
updating a ticket, and closing a ticket.

30
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:25,595
Our application may also need to access and update a user's account information,

31
00:03:25,595 --> 00:03:35,140
branch out to a live technician or even pass along a quality assurance survey.

32
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:43,480
Entities are the objects that we want to act upon.

33
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:50,950
They help us get to the specifies of an interaction.

34
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:56,555
In the dialogue, the entities are the nouns

35
00:03:56,555 --> 00:04:02,920
found through the conversation such as a person's name,

36
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,600
dates and et cetera.

37
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:10,480
In the case of ordering coffee,

38
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:18,100
coffee is an entity but it can also be a grouping.

39
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:28,320
There are many types of coffee such as Americanos, Cappuccinos and Lattes.

40
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:33,090
When we are designing our entity groupings,

41
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:38,755
we need to know how granular the entity should get.

42
00:04:38,755 --> 00:04:49,580
Sometimes, a coffee entity is sufficient but sometimes we need to know finer details.

43
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:59,645
Entity help our chatbot decide what details it needs to know and how it should react.

44
00:04:59,645 --> 00:05:07,895
Entities are also a great way to add personalizations to a chatbot.

45
00:05:07,895 --> 00:05:14,720
We can use an entity and data stored in a database to remember

46
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:22,600
details about a user such as their name or favorite drink.

47
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:33,480
We can then echo those details back turning a rigid conversation into a casual dialogue.

48
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:41,630
Of course, there is a list of building entities to help us start it.

49
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:49,555
Lastly, contacts keeps the continuities in the conversation.

50
00:05:49,555 --> 00:05:54,799
It helps the chatbot keep track of where the user

51
00:05:54,799 --> 00:06:00,410
is at during the course of the conversation.

52
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:06,920
This is helpful for differentiating phrases which may be

53
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:14,460
weak or have different meanings depending on the user's preferences,

54
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:21,635
geographic locations or the topic of the conversation.

55
00:06:21,635 --> 00:06:25,440
For the question of what about tomorrow?

56
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,930
The chatbot needs to pick up the context of

57
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:35,745
the previous question in order to give an appropriate answer.

58
00:06:35,745 --> 00:06:40,475
If the previous question was about weather,

59
00:06:40,475 --> 00:06:44,135
the answer should be about weather.

60
00:06:44,135 --> 00:06:49,295
But if the previous question was about the level of traffic,

61
00:06:49,295 --> 00:06:53,680
then the answer should be about traffic as well.
