1
00:00:00,845 --> 00:00:06,023
That was great we were able
to use the tensor2tensor

2
00:00:06,023 --> 00:00:11,208
to train a sequence to
sequence model quite easily.

3
00:00:11,208 --> 00:00:16,530
But if you noticed,
we have gone through all of the steps

4
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:21,740
of data processing,
machine learning model design,

5
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:26,514
hyper parameter tuning,
evaluation, and etc.

6
00:00:26,514 --> 00:00:32,352
This process is very complex and
time intensive,

7
00:00:32,352 --> 00:00:36,663
is there an automated way to do this?

8
00:00:36,663 --> 00:00:40,687
The answer is yes, for example,

9
00:00:40,687 --> 00:00:47,442
if we wanted to do translation,
we have the input text,

10
00:00:47,442 --> 00:00:53,071
the output text, and
we want to train a model.

11
00:00:53,071 --> 00:01:00,501
We can do it with tensor2tensor,
we can write the problem,

12
00:01:00,501 --> 00:01:05,165
the data generation code ourselves or

13
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:10,412
we can just use
AutoML Translation which is

14
00:01:10,412 --> 00:01:16,697
a completely GUI driven
technology to do it for us.

15
00:01:16,697 --> 00:01:24,710
AutoML Translation makes building
the translation model easier,

16
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:28,926
we just need to follow three steps,

17
00:01:28,926 --> 00:01:33,282
prepare training and the test data,

18
00:01:33,282 --> 00:01:37,514
build model and evaluate results.

19
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:45,699
For the model building step we can
either leverage the pre-built model or

20
00:01:45,699 --> 00:01:50,726
build custom model for
our specific domain.

21
00:01:50,726 --> 00:01:56,564
That is the key differentiation for
AutoML Translation.

22
00:01:59,376 --> 00:02:04,681
Why is the domain specific
translation important?

23
00:02:04,681 --> 00:02:07,532
Let see an example.

24
00:02:07,532 --> 00:02:14,867
Let see, we want to translate
that the driver is not working.

25
00:02:14,867 --> 00:02:18,228
Which is the correct translation?

26
00:02:18,228 --> 00:02:25,681
Is it the golf driver,
the driver of the taxi or

27
00:02:25,681 --> 00:02:30,855
device driver from a software?

28
00:02:30,855 --> 00:02:37,202
This depends on the context,
it depends on what came before.

29
00:02:40,483 --> 00:02:47,244
As we saw the translation may
vary a lot in different domains.

30
00:02:47,244 --> 00:02:52,836
So how could we solve this
with AutoML Translation?

31
00:02:52,836 --> 00:02:58,229
Firstly we can upload translated

32
00:02:58,229 --> 00:03:04,968
language pairs such as, [FOREIGN] a door,

33
00:03:04,968 --> 00:03:11,142
[FOREIGN] two table lamps and so forth.

34
00:03:11,142 --> 00:03:18,025
Then we use AutoML Translation to
train a language translation model.

35
00:03:20,654 --> 00:03:26,795
At the end we evaluate the translations,
just that simple.

36
00:03:28,823 --> 00:03:35,659
Let's see some example in action
from the education domain.

37
00:03:35,659 --> 00:03:40,316
Here we uploaded over 127,000

38
00:03:40,316 --> 00:03:45,851
Blackboard Spanish English sentence pair.

39
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:53,355
A custom model is trained and
evaluated by using the blue scores.

40
00:03:53,355 --> 00:03:59,177
Now for a new sentence in the same
domain we can predict the translation

41
00:03:59,177 --> 00:04:05,689
using both the custom model and the
Google Nueral Machine Translation model,

42
00:04:05,689 --> 00:04:09,260
which predicts the generic translation.

43
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:18,134
Let's take a closer look at some
education related translation.

44
00:04:18,134 --> 00:04:22,526
We have a Spanish

45
00:04:22,526 --> 00:04:28,492
sentence, [FOREIGN].

46
00:04:28,492 --> 00:04:32,169
Without the domain custom model,

47
00:04:32,169 --> 00:04:36,480
the Spanish sentence is translated to,

48
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:43,982
frequently asked questions by
the moderator, which is pretty good.

49
00:04:43,982 --> 00:04:49,744
But with the custom model we got,
moderator FAQs,

50
00:04:49,744 --> 00:04:57,655
which is a much closer translation
that fits in the education domain.
