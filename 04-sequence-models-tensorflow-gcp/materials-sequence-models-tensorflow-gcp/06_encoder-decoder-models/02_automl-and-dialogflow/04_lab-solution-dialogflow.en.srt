1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,160
Congratulations on finishing the lab.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:07,550
Let's quickly go through the lab solutions here.

3
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:11,965
After logging into the dialogue flow console,

4
00:00:11,965 --> 00:00:16,025
I am ready to create my first agent.

5
00:00:16,025 --> 00:00:21,015
Click create agent in the left menu.

6
00:00:21,015 --> 00:00:26,790
Here, I'm going to name the agent new agent.

7
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:31,620
Set the default language, default time zone,

8
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:34,635
and the right Google project,

9
00:00:34,635 --> 00:00:37,575
and click Create button.

10
00:00:37,575 --> 00:00:43,670
This will take a few seconds to set up the new agent.

11
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:51,299
Once the agent is created,

12
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:56,325
I am now looking at the dialogue flow console.

13
00:00:56,325 --> 00:01:01,575
On the left, is the dialogue Flow menu.

14
00:01:01,575 --> 00:01:08,430
The middle shows a list of intense for this agent.

15
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:15,540
By default, dialogue flow agents start with two intense.

16
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:21,780
Default fallback intent and default welcome intent.

17
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:27,155
On the right, is a dialogue flow simulator.

18
00:01:27,155 --> 00:01:29,670
Let's try out.

19
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:37,060
Here I type hi and press enter.

20
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:40,935
My agent understood me.

21
00:01:40,935 --> 00:01:47,035
Since my input match to a default welcome intent,

22
00:01:47,035 --> 00:01:54,020
I receive one off the default replies inside the welcoming intent.

23
00:01:54,690 --> 00:02:05,705
Next, I want my agent to answer some simple questions such as what is your name?

24
00:02:05,705 --> 00:02:12,080
To do so, I am going to add an intent from

25
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:20,640
the left menu and call it name.

26
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,839
In the training phrases session,

27
00:02:25,839 --> 00:02:35,550
I'm going to click on the tax field and enter the following sentences here.

28
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:45,120
What is your name?

29
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:57,310
Do you have a name or just name?

30
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:02,050
In the responses session,

31
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:10,290
I click on the text view again and I'm going to enter a response here.

32
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:21,120
My name is dialogue flow and now I'm going to save.

33
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:24,330
Time to try out.

34
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:31,060
In the simulator, I'm going to ask, what's your name?

35
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:38,640
Notice that even though my query,

36
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:46,805
what's your name is a little bit different than the training phrases what is

37
00:03:46,805 --> 00:03:52,550
your name but the dialogue flow

38
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:58,530
still match the query to the correct name intense here.

39
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:05,980
Now, I'm going to create a more complex intent where some parameters for

40
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:14,215
spoken and programming languages and see how they can match to my specified intent.

41
00:04:14,215 --> 00:04:22,220
Like previously, I am going to add a new intent from the left menu,

42
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:28,240
and name it as languages.

43
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,434
In the training phrases session,

44
00:04:31,434 --> 00:04:35,390
I'll enters three training phrase.

45
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:48,350
I know English, I speak French,

46
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:57,590
and I know how to write in German.

47
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:05,125
Well, I am typing dialogue flow automatically

48
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:11,455
detects knowing entity such as system language in my phrase,

49
00:05:11,455 --> 00:05:17,720
and create a parameter language and its value for me.

50
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:24,355
I can directly use the value of the parameter in my responses.

51
00:05:24,355 --> 00:05:26,675
So, in this case,

52
00:05:26,675 --> 00:05:32,390
I can use dollar sign language in my responses and it

53
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:39,110
will be replaced with the language specified in the user query.

54
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:42,680
In the responses session,

55
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:48,905
I click on the text field again and add one response.

56
00:05:48,905 --> 00:05:57,340
Wow, I didn't know that you knew a language and click on Save button.

57
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:00,140
And time to try out.

58
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:07,020
Here, I'm going to ask, I know Russian?

59
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:11,889
Here the dialogue flow correctly extract

60
00:06:11,889 --> 00:06:19,075
the language parameters with the value Russian from the query.

61
00:06:19,075 --> 00:06:28,070
Also, the parameter value Russian is correctly inserted in the responses.

62
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:35,945
Except using the system entities,

63
00:06:35,945 --> 00:06:39,460
I can also create my own and have

64
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:44,375
the agent understand some programming languages as well.

65
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:48,820
To create entities, I will come back to

66
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:55,729
the left menu and click on the Add button next to the entity.

67
00:06:55,729 --> 00:07:00,900
Our name the entity programming language,

68
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:11,030
and add three programming language and their synonyms,

69
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,440
add a text field.

70
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:19,100
First, we're going to enter JavaScript.

71
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:23,580
JavaScript is also known as JS.

72
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:30,665
The second I going to enter java, and lastly,

73
00:07:30,665 --> 00:07:39,450
for Python also known as PY and click on the Save button.

74
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:46,115
Let's go back to the language intense and add

75
00:07:46,115 --> 00:07:52,620
training phrases and a response for the programming language.

76
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,805
In the training phrases,

77
00:07:59,805 --> 00:08:04,020
I going to add two new training phrases here.

78
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,910
I know JavaScript.

79
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:15,610
I know how to code in Java.

80
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:27,940
While I'm typing, the dialogue flow automatically does the animations in

81
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:34,930
my phrase and create the parameter programming language and its value for me.

82
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:42,320
In the responses, at programming language is cool,

83
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:53,090
[inaudible] and click on Save.

84
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,915
Time to try out.

85
00:08:57,915 --> 00:09:01,050
In the simulator, I'm going to ask,

86
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:05,050
I know how to code in PY.

87
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,965
As you can see here,

88
00:09:13,965 --> 00:09:19,070
PY is correctly detected as a programming language

89
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:25,130
and replaced by its true value Python in the response.

90
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:32,195
Next, I want my agent to handle

91
00:09:32,195 --> 00:09:39,610
some more complex conversation that need full ops and underlying contexts.

92
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:42,895
Still in the languages intent,

93
00:09:42,895 --> 00:09:50,969
I'm going to extend the original responses by adding a follow up question.

94
00:09:53,410 --> 00:10:02,195
So right here, I'm going to ask how long have you knew a language?

95
00:10:02,195 --> 00:10:04,400
And click on Save button.

96
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,055
To add the follow-up intent,

97
00:10:07,055 --> 00:10:13,900
I need to go back to the languages intense from the left menu.

98
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:23,960
I'm going to mouse over the language intense and click on add follow-up intent,

99
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:28,870
then click home custom from the list.

100
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:39,089
Dialogue flow automatically name the new follow-up intent as languages dash costume,

101
00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:45,905
and the arrow here indicates the relationship between two intense.

102
00:10:45,905 --> 00:10:49,155
In this new intent,

103
00:10:49,155 --> 00:10:56,314
I am going to add some training phrases to answer the follow up question,

104
00:10:56,314 --> 00:11:00,100
how long have you knew a language?

105
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:03,000
In their training phrases here,

106
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,340
I'm going to add three years,

107
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:16,270
about four days, for five years,

108
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,690
and click on Save.

109
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:24,645
Time to try out. In the simulator,

110
00:11:24,645 --> 00:11:29,380
I enter I know French.

111
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:34,785
To answer the follow-up question here,

112
00:11:34,785 --> 00:11:40,000
I enter about two weeks.

113
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:50,615
The agent has matched about two weeks to the correct intense language dash costume.

114
00:11:50,615 --> 00:11:56,270
Since I haven't create the responses for this follow up intent,

115
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:59,960
my agent has no response here.

116
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,905
Let me quickly fix this.

117
00:12:02,905 --> 00:12:06,195
In the responses session,

118
00:12:06,195 --> 00:12:10,810
I'm going to add one response.

119
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:20,100
I can't believe you have known language for

120
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:28,270
a duration and click on the Save button and let's try out again.

121
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:32,435
I'm going to type the same query here.

122
00:12:32,435 --> 00:12:42,510
I know French and their response to the follow-up question was one month.

123
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:47,330
Now, I have the proper response back.

124
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:55,420
The language parameter value is retrieved from the contacts and inserted in the response.

125
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,280
This is great.

126
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:02,000
I now have my conversational agent. Yes.
