Now, it's time for you to create your first chatbot using Dialogflow. In this lab, you will familiarize yourself with Dialogflow console, learn to create intents, extract data with entities, manage state with contexts, and tests the chatbot. Don't forget, you have multiple attempt to start and stop each lab. So, don't worry, if you don't make it through on the first time. Also, as a tip, you can take a second attempt at the lab, if you just wanted to experiment with a code before watching the solution video later.
