Now it's time for you to get some
experience with the tensor2tensor. In this lab, you will define
a problem with tensor2tensor. Generate training and evaluation datasets. Customize the sequence to sequence model. Train the model locally and
on Cloud Machine Learning Engine. Fine-tune hyperparameters. Decode lines of poetry. And deploy the model. Don't forget,
you have many attempts to start and stop each lab, so don't worry if you
don't make it through on the first time. Also, as a tip,
you can take a second attempt at the lab even if you just
wanted to experiment with a code before watching
the solution video later.
