1
00:00:01,136 --> 00:00:07,598
Now it's time for you to get some
experience with the tensor2tensor.

2
00:00:07,598 --> 00:00:14,625
In this lab, you will define
a problem with tensor2tensor.

3
00:00:14,625 --> 00:00:20,398
Generate training and evaluation datasets.

4
00:00:20,398 --> 00:00:25,044
Customize the sequence to sequence model.

5
00:00:25,044 --> 00:00:32,065
Train the model locally and
on Cloud Machine Learning Engine.

6
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:36,144
Fine-tune hyperparameters.

7
00:00:36,144 --> 00:00:40,267
Decode lines of poetry.

8
00:00:40,267 --> 00:00:42,047
And deploy the model.

9
00:00:44,067 --> 00:00:49,346
Don't forget,
you have many attempts to start and

10
00:00:49,346 --> 00:00:57,468
stop each lab, so don't worry if you
don't make it through on the first time.

11
00:00:57,468 --> 00:01:02,310
Also, as a tip,
you can take a second attempt at

12
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:07,273
the lab even if you just
wanted to experiment with

13
00:01:07,273 --> 00:01:12,375
a code before watching
the solution video later.
