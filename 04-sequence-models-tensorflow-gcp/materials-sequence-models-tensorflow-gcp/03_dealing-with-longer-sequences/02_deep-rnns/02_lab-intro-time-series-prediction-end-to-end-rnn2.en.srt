1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,950
In this lab, you will implement a two-layer RNN.

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:10,450
First, complete rnn2_model function in the model.py file.

3
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:14,695
Then, test the model locally to make sure the code works.

4
00:00:14,695 --> 00:00:18,600
In this lab, I'd also like you to run the cell in the notebook,

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,165
which runs all model types in parallel.

6
00:00:21,165 --> 00:00:24,090
This will allow you to compare the performance of

7
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,660
the different models head-to-head using tensorboard.
