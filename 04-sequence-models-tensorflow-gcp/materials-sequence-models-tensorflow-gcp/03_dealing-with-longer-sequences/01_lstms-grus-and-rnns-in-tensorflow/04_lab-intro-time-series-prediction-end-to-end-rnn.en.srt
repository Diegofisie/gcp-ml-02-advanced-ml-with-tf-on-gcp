1
00:00:00,467 --> 00:00:04,040
In this lab, we will continue
with the sprinkler problem.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:08,250
This time implementing an RNN
to predict the sprinkler height.

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:12,550
You may use any RNN cell type you like,
but I recommend using a GRU cell.

4
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:14,890
Specifically in this lab,

5
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:19,090
you will complete the rnn_model
function in the model.py file.

6
00:00:20,742 --> 00:00:25,030
Then you'll run the RNN model locally
to make sure your code works.

7
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:29,720
Be sure to specify the --model argument

8
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:34,436
as RNN before you kick off
the local training job.

9
00:00:34,436 --> 00:00:38,566
Keep in mind, you have multiple
attempts to start and stop each lab.

10
00:00:38,566 --> 00:00:40,496
So don't worry if you don't
make it through the first time.

11
00:00:42,046 --> 00:00:44,606
We'll review the solution
together in the following video.
