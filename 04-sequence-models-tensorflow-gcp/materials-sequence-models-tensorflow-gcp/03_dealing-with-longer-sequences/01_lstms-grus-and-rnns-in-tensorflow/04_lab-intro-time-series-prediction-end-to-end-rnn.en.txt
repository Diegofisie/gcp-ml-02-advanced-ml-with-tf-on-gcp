In this lab, we will continue
with the sprinkler problem. This time implementing an RNN
to predict the sprinkler height. You may use any RNN cell type you like,
but I recommend using a GRU cell. Specifically in this lab, you will complete the rnn_model
function in the model.py file. Then you'll run the RNN model locally
to make sure your code works. Be sure to specify the --model argument as RNN before you kick off
the local training job. Keep in mind, you have multiple
attempts to start and stop each lab. So don't worry if you don't
make it through the first time. We'll review the solution
together in the following video.
