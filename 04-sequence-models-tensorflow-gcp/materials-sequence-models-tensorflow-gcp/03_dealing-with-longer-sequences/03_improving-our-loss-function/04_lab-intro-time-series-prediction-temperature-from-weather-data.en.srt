1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:05,320
We've talked about a lot of considerations about real world data.

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:09,290
Now, it's your turn to practice with this next lab.

3
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:12,775
In this lab, you'll see how to resample data,

4
00:00:12,775 --> 00:00:18,000
split up sequences, generate a sequence of predictions and more.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,760
You should proceed in the following order.

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,525
First, run the notebook as is.

7
00:00:23,525 --> 00:00:25,565
Look at the data visualizations,

8
00:00:25,565 --> 00:00:27,940
then look at the predictions at the end.

9
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:34,240
Next, play with the RESAMPLE BY and SEQLEN length hyperparameters.

10
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:40,885
Next, try predicting N data points ahead instead of only one ahead.

11
00:00:40,885 --> 00:00:47,230
Finally, improve your RNN model by adding layers and adding regularization.

12
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:49,460
This is a longer lab.

13
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:53,900
So, keep in mind you have multiple attempts to start and stop each lab,

14
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:57,135
and don't worry if you don't make it through on the first time.

15
00:00:57,135 --> 00:01:01,230
We'll review the solution together in the following video.
