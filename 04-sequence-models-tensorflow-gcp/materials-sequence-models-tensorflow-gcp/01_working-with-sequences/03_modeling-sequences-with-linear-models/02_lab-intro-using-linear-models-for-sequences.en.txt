Let's do our first lab where we'll apply a linear model to our synthetic time series data. In this lab, you will create a linear model by completing the TODOs steps in model.py in your lab notebook. Keep in mind that you have multiple attempts to start and stop each lab, so don't worry if you don't make it through on the first time. We'll review the solution together in the following video.
