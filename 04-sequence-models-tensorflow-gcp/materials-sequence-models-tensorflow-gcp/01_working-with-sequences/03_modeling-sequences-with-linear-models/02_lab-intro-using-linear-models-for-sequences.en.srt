1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,490
Let's do our first lab where we'll apply

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:05,305
a linear model to our synthetic time series data.

3
00:00:05,305 --> 00:00:08,250
In this lab, you will create a linear model by completing

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,690
the TODOs steps in model.py in your lab notebook.

5
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:15,000
Keep in mind that you have multiple attempts to start and stop each lab,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,355
so don't worry if you don't make it through on the first time.

7
00:00:17,355 --> 00:00:20,200
We'll review the solution together in the following video.
