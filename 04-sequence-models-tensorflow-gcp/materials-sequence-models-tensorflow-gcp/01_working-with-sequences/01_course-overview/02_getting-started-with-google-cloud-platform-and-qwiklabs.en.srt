00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,278
Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:01,278 --> 00:00:05,258
I'm Philipp Maier, a course developer
with Google Cloud platform, and

3
00:00:05,258 --> 00:00:08,414
this is a brief tutorial on
using Qwiklabs in this course.

4
00:00:08,414 --> 00:00:12,947
I'm about to show you the interactive
hands-on labs platform called Qwiklabs,

5
00:00:12,947 --> 00:00:14,662
which is part of Google Cloud.

6
00:00:14,662 --> 00:00:19,546
Qwiklabs allows you to get practical,
hands-on experience with GCP, and

7
00:00:19,546 --> 00:00:22,829
provisions you with Google
account credentials so

8
00:00:22,829 --> 00:00:25,516
you can access the GCP console at no cost.

9
00:00:25,516 --> 00:00:29,862
The first step is to log into
Coursera in an incognito window.

10
00:00:29,862 --> 00:00:34,199
Depending on your browser,
it may also be called private browsing or

11
00:00:34,199 --> 00:00:35,631
in private browsing.

12
00:00:35,631 --> 00:00:39,812
Logging into Coursera from a private
window ensures that you don't accidentally

13
00:00:39,812 --> 00:00:43,641
use your own Google account while
accessing the the Google Cloud Console.

14
00:00:43,641 --> 00:00:47,515
We don't want you to get any unexpected
bills at the end of the month.

15
00:00:47,515 --> 00:00:51,871
Check out the links below this video for
different browser support articles.

16
00:00:51,871 --> 00:00:55,174
Once logged into Coursera
using an incognito window,

17
00:00:55,174 --> 00:00:58,417
return to your course and
go to the Lab Activity page.

18
00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:04,543
So if prompted,
you want to accept the Honor Code, and

19
00:01:04,543 --> 00:01:07,285
you might even have to enter your name.

20
00:01:07,285 --> 00:01:11,832
Then you want to click the Open Tool
button to open the lab in a new tab.

21
00:01:14,634 --> 00:01:18,925
So within the new tab,
you can now click Start Lab.

22
00:01:18,925 --> 00:01:22,166
And you want to wait until
the Lab Running is displayed.

23
00:01:26,614 --> 00:01:31,655
For each lab, you will have a timer in the
top right with the remaining access time.

24
00:01:31,655 --> 00:01:35,271
Your lab will automatically
end when the timer runs out.

25
00:01:35,271 --> 00:01:38,695
On the left,
you have the Connection Detail.

26
00:01:38,695 --> 00:01:41,601
Click Open Google Console.

27
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:43,851
And then sign in with the username and

28
00:01:43,851 --> 00:01:47,055
password provided in
the connections detail pane.

29
00:01:47,055 --> 00:01:53,237
So I'm going to copy the username,
paste that in here.

30
00:01:53,237 --> 00:01:57,423
I'm also going to take the password.

31
00:01:57,423 --> 00:01:59,270
Paste it in here too.

32
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:02,843
Now Qwiklabs creates a new account for
you each time you launch a lab.

33
00:02:02,843 --> 00:02:06,442
Therefore you need to click through
the initial account set up windows.

34
00:02:06,442 --> 00:02:08,451
So essentially I need to accept this.

35
00:02:10,374 --> 00:02:12,724
I don't need to add any
recovery phone number.

36
00:02:12,724 --> 00:02:13,913
I can just click Done.

37
00:02:17,712 --> 00:02:21,466
I'm going to agree to the terms and
services, and I don't need any emails.

38
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:29,058
Now I can verify that I'm using
the Qwiklabs provided account and

39
00:02:29,058 --> 00:02:31,008
project within a GCP console.

40
00:02:31,008 --> 00:02:33,490
So up here, I see the Project ID.

41
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:39,714
And over here, I can see the Username.

42
00:02:39,714 --> 00:02:43,951
And these are the same ones that I
was provided with in the connections

43
00:02:43,951 --> 00:02:44,837
detail pane.

44
00:02:44,837 --> 00:02:48,559
You can also see that
the timer is still running.

45
00:02:48,559 --> 00:02:53,198
Now some labs track your work within
the Qwiklab provided GCP project.

46
00:02:53,198 --> 00:02:57,824
If this is enabled, you'll see a score in
the top right corner of the quick lab's

47
00:02:57,824 --> 00:02:59,741
window as you can see right here.

48
00:02:59,741 --> 00:03:02,471
Your score increases as
objectives are met and

49
00:03:02,471 --> 00:03:06,330
you can click on the score to view
the individual steps to be scored

50
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:13,383
Now that I've completed the lab,
I can see my score has been updated.

51
00:03:13,383 --> 00:03:16,343
And I'm ready to click End Lab.

52
00:03:16,343 --> 00:03:20,844
Once I click End Lab,
the Qwiklabs provided project and

53
00:03:20,844 --> 00:03:25,068
any resources within that
project will be deleted.

54
00:03:25,068 --> 00:03:27,529
I can close the Qwiklabs lab page and

55
00:03:27,529 --> 00:03:31,310
my grade will be updated with
my lab score in Coursera.

56
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,828
That's it for this tutorial.

57
00:03:32,828 --> 00:03:36,048
Remember to launch Coursera
in an incognito window and

58
00:03:36,048 --> 00:03:40,110
use the Qwiklabs provided credentials
to sign in to the GCP console.

59
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:43,374
Good luck with the labs and
enjoy the rest of this course.
