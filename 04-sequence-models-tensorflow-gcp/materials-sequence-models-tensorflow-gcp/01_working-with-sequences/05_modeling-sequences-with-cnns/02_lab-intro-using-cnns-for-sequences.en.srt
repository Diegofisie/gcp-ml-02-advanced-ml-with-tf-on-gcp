1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,940
Let's do our third lab,

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:05,485
where we'll apply a CNN to our synthetic time series data.

3
00:00:05,485 --> 00:00:07,830
In this lab, you'll create a CNN model by

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:10,830
completing the TODOs steps in the model.py file.

5
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:14,040
Keep in mind, you have multiple attempts to start and stop each lab,

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,340
so don't worry if you don't make it through the first time.

7
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,370
We'll review the solution together in the following video.
