1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,055
Let's do our second lab,

2
00:00:02,055 --> 00:00:05,410
where we'll apply a DNN to our synthetic time series data.

3
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:07,250
In this lab, like in the first one,

4
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:11,680
you'll create a DNN model by completing the TODOs steps in model.py file.

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,770
Keep in mind you have multiple times to start and stop each lab.

6
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:16,885
So, don't worry if you don't make it through the first time.

7
00:00:16,885 --> 00:00:19,830
We'll review the solution together in the following video.
