Let's practice using TensorFlow Hub
to create reusable embeddings in this next lab. In this lab, we'll instantiate
a TensorFlow Hub module and take a closer look at
the embeddings it produces. We'll start by looking to see if basic
semantic relationships are preserved, and then use a more formal analysis. Your tasks will be to modify
the notebook to instantiate the module, choose some words to test, and
then examine those embeddings.
