00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:03,940
Let's practice using TensorFlow Hub
to create reusable embeddings in

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:04,470
this next lab.

3
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:09,070
In this lab, we'll instantiate
a TensorFlow Hub module and

4
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:12,010
take a closer look at
the embeddings it produces.

5
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:15,550
We'll start by looking to see if basic
semantic relationships are preserved, and

6
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:17,920
then use a more formal analysis.

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,690
Your tasks will be to modify
the notebook to instantiate the module,

8
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:24,420
choose some words to test, and
then examine those embeddings.
