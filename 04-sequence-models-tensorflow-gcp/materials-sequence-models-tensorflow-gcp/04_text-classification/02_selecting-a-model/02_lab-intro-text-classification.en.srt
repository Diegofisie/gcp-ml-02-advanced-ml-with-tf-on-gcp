1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,280
In this lab, we'll build a model to
solve the text classification problem

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:05,260
we've been talking about.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,601
All of the lab TODOs are in
the model.py file, in particular,

4
00:00:11,601 --> 00:00:15,760
you will transform text into
a sequence of integers.

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:20,930
Pad sequences to a constant length,
convert a karas model

6
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:26,030
into a tf estimator, and
instantiate a tf.Estimator.

7
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:31,560
Finally, you will train and deploy your
model using Cloud Machine Learning Engine.

8
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,526
And feed in new article titles to
the deployed model for prediction,

9
00:00:37,286 --> 00:00:41,076
keep in mind, you have multiple
attempts to start and stop each lab.

10
00:00:41,076 --> 00:00:44,206
So don't worry if you don't
make it through the first time,

11
00:00:44,206 --> 00:00:46,926
we'll review the solution
together in the following video.
