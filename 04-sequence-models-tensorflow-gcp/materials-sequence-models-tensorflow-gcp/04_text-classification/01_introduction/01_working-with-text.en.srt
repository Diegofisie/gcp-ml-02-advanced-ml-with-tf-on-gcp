Hi there. Vijay here again.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:08,515
One of the most common questions we find in machine learning is how to classify text.

3
00:00:08,515 --> 00:00:12,210
In this module, we'll look at different ways of working with text,

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,245
and how to create your own text classification models.

5
00:00:15,245 --> 00:00:18,390
We'll start with discussing how to work with text,

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:22,255
then we'll talk about how we can classify text using machine learning.

7
00:00:22,255 --> 00:00:26,990
We'll close with a discussion about Python versus native Tensorflow functions for

8
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:32,820
pre-processing text and some tips for productionizing your text classification model.

9
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:37,025
Up until now, we've been working directly with numbers.

10
00:00:37,025 --> 00:00:39,420
In our first labs using sequences,

11
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,190
those numbers represented the height of water from a sprinkler.

12
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:45,010
Our most recent lab,

13
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:47,094
they represented temperature readings.

14
00:00:47,094 --> 00:00:50,255
However, not all sequences are numeric.

15
00:00:50,255 --> 00:00:52,660
Take natural language for example.

16
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:55,495
The words in a sentence are a sequence.

17
00:00:55,495 --> 00:00:59,670
Why? Because the order of the words matter.

18
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,400
If you change the order of words in a sentence,

19
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,190
it no longer makes sense.

20
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:06,650
So, sequential models allow us to capture

21
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:10,500
the meaning of sentences better than non-sequential models.

22
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,470
So, what practical use cases can we tackle with natural language?
