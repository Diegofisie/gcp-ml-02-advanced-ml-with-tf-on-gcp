1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,380
Now, that we have learned how

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:04,410
WALS matrix factorization works for collaborative filtering,

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:06,450
let's put our new knowledge to action.

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:08,505
This lab demonstrates how to implement

5
00:00:08,505 --> 00:00:10,650
a WALS matrix factorization approach to

6
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,185
do collaborative filtering using Google Analytics Data.

7
00:00:13,185 --> 00:00:15,780
We'll be using most of the code that we learned earlier.

8
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:20,955
In later modules, we will combine this and content-based with a deep neural network,

9
00:00:20,955 --> 00:00:22,860
and then learn how to productionize and automate

10
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:26,190
our solution using the Google Cloud platform ecosystem.

11
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:30,060
In this lab, we will be completing the to-dos in the WALS notebook.

12
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,680
Specifically, we will need to complete the decode example function,

13
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,495
where we decode the TF record protos and store the result in our dataset.

14
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:38,970
Also, we need to add

15
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:42,470
the WALS matrix factorization estimator within the batch predict function.

16
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:44,930
Making sure to include call to the input function,

17
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:48,140
serve an input function and our vocabularies.
