Hello, my name is Lak,

2
00:00:02,535 --> 00:00:08,070
and I led the team that put together this course and this specialization.

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:13,515
We started out this course by explaining what recommendation systems are.

4
00:00:13,515 --> 00:00:16,620
We said that when you watch a video on YouTube

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:20,205
and you see a list of suggested videos to watch next,

6
00:00:20,205 --> 00:00:24,945
that list is being built by recommendation machine learning model.

7
00:00:24,945 --> 00:00:31,950
You can't just build a recommendation engine and ML model and call it a day,

8
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:36,825
you also need to build the entire end-to-end system.

9
00:00:36,825 --> 00:00:40,994
We looked at how to build content-based recommendation systems,

10
00:00:40,994 --> 00:00:44,090
where the system recommends items to

11
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:48,995
users based on metadata that's known about the items.

12
00:00:48,995 --> 00:00:51,875
We then learned how to implement

13
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:57,174
collaborative filtering where you don't have any metadata about the products or users,

14
00:00:57,174 --> 00:01:01,070
instead you learn about item similarity and

15
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:06,005
user similarity from ratings data or interaction data.

16
00:01:06,005 --> 00:01:09,880
Because this interaction matrix is very large,

17
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,430
we use the alternating least squares algorithm to

18
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:19,625
factorize the interaction matrix into user factors and item factors.

19
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:25,340
Then, if we need to find whether a user will like a particular movie,

20
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,920
it's as simple as taking the row corresponding to

21
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,890
the user and the column corresponding to the movie,

22
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:34,150
and multiplying them to get the predicted rating.

23
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:37,380
To recommend movies to users,

24
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:42,230
we can then recommend the movies that we predict they will rate the highest.

25
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:44,465
We did this in TensorFlow.

26
00:01:44,465 --> 00:01:50,145
Then, we looked at how to build a hybrid recommendation system.

27
00:01:50,145 --> 00:01:54,530
The hybrid model uses all the data available and

28
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:59,345
connects all of these models together into a machine learning pipeline.

29
00:01:59,345 --> 00:02:02,695
Finally, we learned how to productionize

30
00:02:02,695 --> 00:02:05,840
and automate the machine learning pipeline in order to

31
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:12,505
build and continuously retrain an end-to-end recommendation system.

32
00:02:12,505 --> 00:02:16,340
We were able to orchestrate the continuous retraining of

33
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:22,130
the recommendation system as new ratings data keeps coming in from users.

34
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:27,155
With this, we come to the end of this course on recommendation systems.

35
00:02:27,155 --> 00:02:31,120
Thank you for accompanying us on this journey.
