00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,330
Using neural networks to combine all the advantages and eliminate

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:07,875
the disadvantages of the three broad types of recommendation systems is very powerful.

3
00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:11,580
We were able to eliminate or at least mitigate the disadvantages of

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,635
each broad recommendation system approach

5
00:00:13,635 --> 00:00:16,695
and use full advantage of their individual strengths.

6
00:00:16,695 --> 00:00:19,350
These hybrid models fortunately don't use

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,325
any fancy new system and just build off of what we already have.

8
00:00:23,325 --> 00:00:25,705
However, to get the full power to them,

9
00:00:25,705 --> 00:00:27,920
we should provide as much data as possible from

10
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,315
many different sources and connect all these models together into an ML pipeline.

11
00:00:32,315 --> 00:00:36,185
We put all this together ourselves in a hybrid neural network lab.

12
00:00:36,185 --> 00:00:39,065
We learned about how context factors into our experiences with

13
00:00:39,065 --> 00:00:43,085
items such as what our mood was at the time like our stress level,

14
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:46,370
who else we experience things with like our family,

15
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:50,630
where we experience things that matter from the everyday locations to the truly amazing,

16
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:54,485
how time plays a factor in our experience such as the difference in seasons,

17
00:00:54,485 --> 00:00:57,380
or if we are experiencing things during special occasions,

18
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:00,280
wrapped up with the emotion, excitement, and expectations.

19
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,480
We learn how to take this context and use it with

20
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,795
the three main approaches of context-aware recommendation systems,

21
00:01:05,795 --> 00:01:09,430
contextual pre-filtering, post-filtering, and modeling.

22
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:11,870
Lastly, we learned about some of the inner workings of

23
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,675
the YouTube video hybrid recommendation system and saw how

24
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:17,600
two different neural networks harnessing enormous amounts of

25
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,395
data can create some very powerful recommendations to delight its users.

26
00:01:21,395 --> 00:01:23,175
In the next module,

27
00:01:23,175 --> 00:01:27,290
we will see how we can productionize and automate much of the necessary pipeline using

28
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:29,840
the greater Google Cloud Platform ecosystem to make

29
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,230
our hybrid neural network recommendation system even better.
