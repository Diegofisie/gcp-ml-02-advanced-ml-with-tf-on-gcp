Using neural networks to combine all the advantages and eliminate the disadvantages of the three broad types of recommendation systems is very powerful. We were able to eliminate or at least mitigate the disadvantages of each broad recommendation system approach and use full advantage of their individual strengths. These hybrid models fortunately don't use any fancy new system and just build off of what we already have. However, to get the full power to them, we should provide as much data as possible from many different sources and connect all these models together into an ML pipeline. We put all this together ourselves in a hybrid neural network lab. We learned about how context factors into our experiences with items such as what our mood was at the time like our stress level, who else we experience things with like our family, where we experience things that matter from the everyday locations to the truly amazing, how time plays a factor in our experience such as the difference in seasons, or if we are experiencing things during special occasions, wrapped up with the emotion, excitement, and expectations. We learn how to take this context and use it with the three main approaches of context-aware recommendation systems, contextual pre-filtering, post-filtering, and modeling. Lastly, we learned about some of the inner workings of the YouTube video hybrid recommendation system and saw how two different neural networks harnessing enormous amounts of data can create some very powerful recommendations to delight its users. In the next module, we will see how we can productionize and automate much of the necessary pipeline using the greater Google Cloud Platform ecosystem to make our hybrid neural network recommendation system even better.
