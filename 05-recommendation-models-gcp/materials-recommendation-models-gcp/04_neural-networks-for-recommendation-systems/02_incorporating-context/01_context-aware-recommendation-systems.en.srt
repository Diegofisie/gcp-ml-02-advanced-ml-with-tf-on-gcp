1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,860
So, we've seen how to combine

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:04,830
the three main types of recommendation systems into a hybrid model,

3
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,515
but some of these were somewhat stateless piece of the data.

4
00:00:07,515 --> 00:00:10,440
We don't know what is going on with someone who's interacting with

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,700
an item that could have changed how they felt about it.

6
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,380
The context that was experienced in matters,

7
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:20,825
if the context was different and the perception of enjoyment could be different as well.

8
00:00:20,825 --> 00:00:23,245
This change perception affects sentiment,

9
00:00:23,245 --> 00:00:26,400
which can change the feedback provided by the user about the item.

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,450
Therefore, an item is not just an item and the user is not just a user.

11
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:32,400
There is more nuance to them,

12
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,515
and that comes from context.

13
00:00:34,515 --> 00:00:36,370
Context is not simple,

14
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:40,040
it is built up of many components that are users or membrane from the past,

15
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,130
experiencing the present, and looking forward to in the future.

16
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:44,780
Imagine watching a movie,

17
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:46,565
what is your mood of the time?

18
00:00:46,565 --> 00:00:50,720
Are you super relaxed curled up on the couch with the bowl of ice cream?

19
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,320
Are you completely tired from a long day at work,

20
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,920
stressed from a long commute home,

21
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,695
and worried about finishing your project for the deadline tomorrow?

22
00:00:57,695 --> 00:01:01,625
This problem makes a difference in how you perceive and enjoy the movie.

23
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:04,990
It also depends on who you're experiencing the item with.

24
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:06,855
Back to our movie example,

25
00:01:06,855 --> 00:01:09,725
what if you were watching a movie with your kids on the couch?

26
00:01:09,725 --> 00:01:12,290
What if instead it's on the couch with your partner?

27
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:14,540
What if instead it's brand-new and economy

28
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,170
seats on an airplane with a bunch of random strangers?

29
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:21,080
The experience will be totally different depending on who you are with,

30
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,750
and can affect how you would rate the item.

31
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:26,345
Location, location, location.

32
00:01:26,345 --> 00:01:29,725
Where we experience things matters a lot when it comes to our perception.

33
00:01:29,725 --> 00:01:31,790
Watching a movie at home is

34
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:34,340
a different experience from watching a movie at a movie theater,

35
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:37,880
watching a movie on a pop-up big screen under the stars campaign in

36
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,570
the desert is totally different and will affect our rating as well.

37
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:45,050
Time is also a factor in how we judge our experiences.

38
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:49,250
Imagine we can travel to the same place where we can go into winter or summer,

39
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,859
this can be drastically different experiences.

40
00:01:51,859 --> 00:01:54,920
Let's say we stay at a bed and breakfast in

41
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,220
the hot summer and the air conditioning is broken the whole time,

42
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,810
so we give them a low rating.

43
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:02,540
However, if we chose to go in the cold winter,

44
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,880
we give it a high rating because they always provide

45
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,245
a delicious hot breakfast and the house was kept nice and cozy with a great furnace.

46
00:02:09,245 --> 00:02:12,710
Even if the air conditioner had been broken in our winter example,

47
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:15,770
that component of the bed and breakfast we didn't interact with,

48
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:19,180
because it wasn't needed and therefore didn't influence our rating.

49
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:22,705
Same place, different times, different ratings.

50
00:02:22,705 --> 00:02:24,885
Perhaps it is a special occasion,

51
00:02:24,885 --> 00:02:27,050
special occasions can heighten our sensitivity to

52
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:30,925
experience because there are emotions, expectations et cetera.

53
00:02:30,925 --> 00:02:35,750
Going to a restaurant for a quick lunch with a friend is highly different from going to

54
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,820
the same place for your wedding rehearsal dinner

55
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,400
with your entire family the night before the big day.

56
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,265
Even going to a restaurant on your birthday is a special event,

57
00:02:43,265 --> 00:02:45,725
hence why a lot of restaurants offer free desserts,

58
00:02:45,725 --> 00:02:47,825
come sing a birthday song, et cetera,

59
00:02:47,825 --> 00:02:49,955
because they want you to have a good experience

60
00:02:49,955 --> 00:02:52,280
especially because you're special occasion changes

61
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:57,280
your perception and you may be more likely to rate more strongly one way or the other.

62
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,064
Context-aware recommendation systems or CARS,

63
00:03:01,064 --> 00:03:04,880
add an extra dimension to our usual collaborative filtering problem.

64
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:09,110
Traditional collaborative filtering recommendation systems use a rank two tensor,

65
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:13,890
a user-item interaction matrix containing explicit or implicit ratings.

66
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:17,615
Contextual collaborative filtering recommendation systems on the other hand,

67
00:03:17,615 --> 00:03:20,495
use a multidimensional tensor,

68
00:03:20,495 --> 00:03:23,210
but the user-item interaction matrix flow ratings

69
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:26,060
is stratified across multiple dimensions of context.

70
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:29,705
Here's an example of some user-item-context data for movies.

71
00:03:29,705 --> 00:03:35,395
There is a user column that lists the user IDs and item column that lists the movie IDs,

72
00:03:35,395 --> 00:03:38,660
a who column that list who the user watched the movie with,

73
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:41,480
a where column that list where the user watched the movie,

74
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:45,695
a when column that lists what the movie was watched on a weekday or weekend,

75
00:03:45,695 --> 00:03:50,050
and lastly a rating column at list explicit rating left for that user.

76
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:53,690
As you can see, this data is much more complex than

77
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:57,425
just a typical user-item-rating matrix we are used to.

78
00:03:57,425 --> 00:04:00,465
We might notice that this table is not complete.

79
00:04:00,465 --> 00:04:03,320
We want to predict what user two will rate movie three,

80
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,725
if they see the movie with their partner at home on a weekday.

81
00:04:06,725 --> 00:04:08,280
With the traditional method,

82
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,310
we would just want to predict what user two will rate

83
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:13,285
the item altogether not considering context,

84
00:04:13,285 --> 00:04:15,530
but hopefully context here will allow us to better

85
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:18,200
predict how they would rate the movie within that situation.

86
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,720
Note, this particular rating could be different from

87
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,990
our rating period for the same user and item but with a different context.

88
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:26,510
For example, it could be a different rating for user two

89
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:28,970
for movie three with their partner at home,

90
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:31,150
but now on the weekend,

91
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:33,295
plus all the other permutations.

92
00:04:33,295 --> 00:04:35,605
So, how does this work?

93
00:04:35,605 --> 00:04:39,250
We should first look at the user of interests interaction history.

94
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:43,040
As you can see here, user two has also watched movies one and two,

95
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,065
movie one was with friends at home on the weekend and they give a rating of three,

96
00:04:47,065 --> 00:04:51,125
movie two was with family at home on a weekday and they give a rating of four.

97
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:54,260
None of the contexts are exactly the same as our movie of interest,

98
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:57,380
but both are seen at home which matches our target location,

99
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:01,180
movie two was seen on a weekday just like our unit of interest.

100
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:05,525
We also should look at the item of interests user-interaction history.

101
00:05:05,525 --> 00:05:09,065
We can see that both user one and user three have rated this movie,

102
00:05:09,065 --> 00:05:13,370
user one was with your partner and an event on a weekday and gave it a rating of five,

103
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:16,520
user three watched the movie also with their partner but now at

104
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,620
home and now on the weekend and only give it a rating of one.

105
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:25,340
Once again, none of the contexts perfectly match to our target ratings contexts,

106
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:28,460
but individually all three are with their partners,

107
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,470
user two also saw the movie at home,

108
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:33,130
and user one also saw the movie on a weekday.

109
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:35,420
So, how do we algorithmically use

110
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:38,000
this data to predict ratings from other recommendations?

111
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,765
Now, that we've learned about how context can affect user-item interactions,

112
00:05:41,765 --> 00:05:43,505
let's test our knowledge.

113
00:05:43,505 --> 00:05:47,485
We learned that context can be important when thinking about user-item interactions.

114
00:05:47,485 --> 00:05:51,515
Which is not an example of context for a user-item interaction?

115
00:05:51,515 --> 00:05:53,405
Watching a movie at the theater,

116
00:05:53,405 --> 00:05:55,250
watching a movie with family,

117
00:05:55,250 --> 00:06:00,020
relaxing on the couch on the weekend with a movie, the length of a movie,

118
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,955
your mood while watching a movie,

119
00:06:01,955 --> 00:06:03,555
watching a movie late at night,

120
00:06:03,555 --> 00:06:06,055
or watching movie and a big watch party?

121
00:06:06,055 --> 00:06:08,240
The correct answer is D,

122
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,775
the length of a movie is a property of the item itself,

123
00:06:10,775 --> 00:06:13,120
not the context that experienced in.

124
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,960
That is not to say that context

125
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,300
can't have a role related to the length of the movie though.

126
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:22,755
Perhaps the user is relaxing on a weekend and they enjoy a very long movie, however,

127
00:06:22,755 --> 00:06:24,890
if they were to have watched that same movie after

128
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:28,100
a stressful day at work and then you just start getting dinner ready for the family,

129
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,810
they might get frustrated of its length because I just want to get to the ending already.

130
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:33,795
The length itself isn't context,

131
00:06:33,795 --> 00:06:37,690
it's component of the item that is evaluated differently based on context.

132
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:40,935
Watching a movie at the theater is a great example of location,

133
00:06:40,935 --> 00:06:42,755
change the context of your experience.

134
00:06:42,755 --> 00:06:45,710
Of course, the other factor is still come into play like,

135
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:47,630
who is also watching in the theater,

136
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:49,145
when the user wanted the theater,

137
00:06:49,145 --> 00:06:51,625
was a special screening, et cetera.

138
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:55,470
Watching movie with family is mostly hidden on the who part of contexts,

139
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:57,470
but of course, where it's being watched at,

140
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:59,920
when, et cetera comes into play.

141
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:04,640
Relaxing on the weekend with a movie taps mainly on the when aspect of context,

142
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:08,090
but relaxing also hints that mood might be part of the context,

143
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:11,645
not to mention where the user's relaxing et cetera.

144
00:07:11,645 --> 00:07:15,960
Your mood while watching a movie definitely changes the context is viewed in,

145
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,155
and lead to differences in perception as well as

146
00:07:18,155 --> 00:07:21,230
all the other pieces of contexts going on during the movie.

147
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:23,330
Watching a movie late at night, once again,

148
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:25,145
mainly focuses on the context of time,

149
00:07:25,145 --> 00:07:26,900
but where it's being watched, with who,

150
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,845
et cetera, can always affect the rating.

151
00:07:29,845 --> 00:07:33,920
Lastly, watching movie at a big watch party maybe a special occasion,

152
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,600
hence, a very different contexts and as the movie

153
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,600
was watched with more typical conditions.

154
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:42,350
As you can see, there never really is just one facet of context going on at once,

155
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:44,255
all of them are happening simultaneously,

156
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:47,350
and all can affect how a user perceives an item.
