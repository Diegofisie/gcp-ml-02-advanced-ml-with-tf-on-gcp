Now it's time to see whether we can combine all of this together. In this lab, we'll make a Neural Network Hybrid Recommendation System using again Google Analytics data. In this lab, we'll be completing the to-dos in the hybrid recommendations notebook. We will need to create an input layer for our feature columns using our join datasets. We will then need to connect this together with a deep neural network via layers. Lastly, we'll need to create our output layer with our labels so that we can make our recommendations.
