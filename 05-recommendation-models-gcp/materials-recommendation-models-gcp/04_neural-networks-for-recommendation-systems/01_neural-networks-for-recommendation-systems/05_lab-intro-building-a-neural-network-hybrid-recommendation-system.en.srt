1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,700
Now it's time to see whether we can combine all of this together.

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:04,800
In this lab, we'll make

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,720
a Neural Network Hybrid Recommendation System using again Google Analytics data.

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,785
In this lab, we'll be completing the to-dos in the hybrid recommendations notebook.

5
00:00:13,785 --> 00:00:18,300
We will need to create an input layer for our feature columns using our join datasets.

6
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,215
We will then need to connect this together with a deep neural network via layers.

7
00:00:22,215 --> 00:00:24,615
Lastly, we'll need to create our output layer

8
00:00:24,615 --> 00:00:27,660
with our labels so that we can make our recommendations.
