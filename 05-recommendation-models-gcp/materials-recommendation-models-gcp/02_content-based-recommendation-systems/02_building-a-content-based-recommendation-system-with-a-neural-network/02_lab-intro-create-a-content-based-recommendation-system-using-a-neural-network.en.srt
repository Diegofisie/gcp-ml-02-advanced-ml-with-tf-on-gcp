00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:02,480
Now it's time for you to give it a try.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,430
In this lab, we'll build a content-based
recommender using a neural network

3
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:10,860
to recommend the next article to read for
visitors of the Courier website.

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,360
First, we'll see how to use big query
to collect information from the Courier

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:18,830
website Google Analytics data and
build our training and test sets.

6
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:22,420
Then you'll use this data to construct the
feature columns that will feed into our

7
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:26,200
neural network, including cross columns
combining some of our features.

8
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,140
We'll also create additional metrics to
assess the performance of our model, and

9
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,520
pass this metric to TensorBoard so
we can monitor our performance.
