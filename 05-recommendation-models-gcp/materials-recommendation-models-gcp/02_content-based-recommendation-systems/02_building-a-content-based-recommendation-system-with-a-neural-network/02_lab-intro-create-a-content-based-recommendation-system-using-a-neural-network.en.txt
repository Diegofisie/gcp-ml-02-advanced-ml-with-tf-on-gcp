Now it's time for you to give it a try. In this lab, we'll build a content-based
recommender using a neural network to recommend the next article to read for
visitors of the Courier website. First, we'll see how to use big query
to collect information from the Courier website Google Analytics data and
build our training and test sets. Then you'll use this data to construct the
feature columns that will feed into our neural network, including cross columns
combining some of our features. We'll also create additional metrics to
assess the performance of our model, and pass this metric to TensorBoard so
we can monitor our performance.
