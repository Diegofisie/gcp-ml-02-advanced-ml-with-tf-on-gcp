00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,020
Now that we have learned the basic implementation of content-based filtering,

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:05,820
let's turn knowledge into action.

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:09,750
This lab demonstrates how to build a content-based recommender using TensorFlow.

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:13,590
We'll put code to the multiple user method we just discussed,

5
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:15,795
using most of the code we just saw.

6
00:00:15,795 --> 00:00:20,200
You'll see how this can all be done using only low-level TensorFlow operations.
