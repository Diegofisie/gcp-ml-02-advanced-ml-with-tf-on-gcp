1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,930
Now, we can make the best recommendation for

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:06,540
our user based on their user feature vector and

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,960
the features of the unrated unseen movies in our database.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,835
To do this, we'll use a similarity measure like we described previously.

5
00:00:14,835 --> 00:00:19,230
Basically, we'll compute the dot product to measure the similarity between

6
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,925
our user and all the remaining unranked movies in our database.

7
00:00:23,925 --> 00:00:29,235
The movie with the greatest similarity measure is our top recommendation for our user.

8
00:00:29,235 --> 00:00:32,190
The dot product is found by taking the component

9
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:35,805
wise product across each dimension and adding the results.

10
00:00:35,805 --> 00:00:38,790
That is we multiply the user feature vector

11
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:42,495
component-wise with the movie feature vector for each movie,

12
00:00:42,495 --> 00:00:47,085
and then sum row-wise to compute the dot product.

13
00:00:47,085 --> 00:00:53,075
This gives us the dot product similarity between our user and each of the four movies.

14
00:00:53,075 --> 00:00:56,680
We'll use these values to make our recommendations.

15
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,155
Because Star Wars has the greatest similarity measure,

16
00:01:00,155 --> 00:01:02,180
that will be our top recommendation,

17
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,755
followed by the Incredibles,

18
00:01:03,755 --> 00:01:07,080
and then The Dark Knight, and lastly, Memento.

19
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:12,555
In the last quiz, we computed this to be the user feature vector for that user.

20
00:01:12,555 --> 00:01:14,805
Using this user feature vector,

21
00:01:14,805 --> 00:01:18,870
which movie would be our top recommendation for this user?

22
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:23,770
Remember, these are the movie feature vectors for the three movies.

23
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:26,605
The answer here is, again, Star Wars.

24
00:01:26,605 --> 00:01:29,880
Do you know what movie to recommend second?

25
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:32,870
To come to that conclusion,

26
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:36,310
we take the dot product of our user feature vector with each movie.

27
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:39,185
We find that Star Wars has the greatest similarity measure.

28
00:01:39,185 --> 00:01:41,090
So, it's our top recommendation.

29
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:44,420
Next, would be Blue, and lastly, Shrek.
