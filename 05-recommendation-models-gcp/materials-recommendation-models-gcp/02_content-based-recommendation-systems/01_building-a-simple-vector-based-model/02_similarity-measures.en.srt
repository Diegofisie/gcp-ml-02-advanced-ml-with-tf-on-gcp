1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,950
In the quiz we had earlier,

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:05,085
we had some idea that The Incredibles and Shrek were similar.

3
00:00:05,085 --> 00:00:07,890
But what does it mean for two movies to be similar?

4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:11,035
We can try to answer this question in a number of ways.

5
00:00:11,035 --> 00:00:15,735
One way is to consider the different genres or themes a movie has.

6
00:00:15,735 --> 00:00:19,260
If there's a lot of overlapping themes between the two movies,

7
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,750
then perhaps we can say the movies are similar.

8
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,860
In the same way, we can ask what it means for two users to be similar.

9
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,800
We could try to use the same genre analysis or

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,700
another reasonable approach would be to consider the movies they've liked in the past.

11
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,505
If two users liked all the same movies,

12
00:00:35,505 --> 00:00:38,235
we can say that those two users are similar.

13
00:00:38,235 --> 00:00:40,140
To do machine learning,

14
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,410
we want to compare movies and users.

15
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:45,650
So, we need to make this notion of similarity more rigorous.

16
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:50,120
This is often done by thinking of properties or features of items and

17
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:55,490
users in the same embedding space where we can then compare how similar they are.

18
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:59,000
An embedding is a map from our collection of items

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,105
or users to some finite dimensional vector space,

20
00:01:02,105 --> 00:01:04,580
it provides a way of giving a finite vector valued

21
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:08,195
representation of the items and users in our data set.

22
00:01:08,195 --> 00:01:12,760
Embeddings are commonly used to represent input features and machine learning problems.

23
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,690
In fact, we've already seen how embeddings can

24
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:17,435
arise and some of the examples from previous modules.

25
00:01:17,435 --> 00:01:19,880
Here's a visualization of the MNIST data set of

26
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,630
handwritten images embedded into 3-dimensions.

27
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:23,985
If you look closely,

28
00:01:23,985 --> 00:01:26,360
this embedding show us all the ones lie in

29
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,350
the same general area and other tools like together as well and so on.

30
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:32,840
Lets go back to our movie example and consider

31
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,410
a two dimensional embedding for the elements in our data set.

32
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:40,535
That is, supposed we described our movies using just two genres or dimensions.

33
00:01:40,535 --> 00:01:42,560
Say drama and fantasy.

34
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,535
We put drama on the x-axis and fantasy on the y-axis.

35
00:01:46,535 --> 00:01:48,860
A movie like Momento scores high in

36
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:52,670
the drama genre but has a relatively low value for fantasy,

37
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:57,655
whereas Harry Potter measures high for fantasy but only medium for drama.

38
00:01:57,655 --> 00:02:00,950
A new movie like Star Wars might appear to be closer to

39
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:04,295
Harry Potter and it's embedded space, but how close?

40
00:02:04,295 --> 00:02:08,720
To make this precise, consider the following embedding values for the movies here.

41
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,470
A similarity measure is just a metric that defines exactly

42
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:16,100
how similar are close to items are in the embedding space.

43
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:20,085
One commonly used similarity measure is the dot product.

44
00:02:20,085 --> 00:02:22,670
To compute the dot product of two vectors,

45
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:26,435
we compute the sum of the product wise components of each vector.

46
00:02:26,435 --> 00:02:29,405
Because 26 is greater than 19,

47
00:02:29,405 --> 00:02:33,320
Star Wars is more similar to Harry Potter than it is to Memento,

48
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,820
which confirms our intuition.

49
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:40,460
The cosine similarity is another popularly used similarity measure,

50
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:45,005
it's similar to the dot product that scaled with a norm of the movie feature vectors.

51
00:02:45,005 --> 00:02:49,655
Note the similarity is still greatest between Harry Potter and Star Wars.

52
00:02:49,655 --> 00:02:53,840
Lets have a quick quiz to check our understanding of similarity measures.

53
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,810
Compute the cosine similarity between Star Wars and

54
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:59,704
Shrek and between Harry Potter and The Incredibles,

55
00:02:59,704 --> 00:03:03,040
which pair of movies is more similar?

56
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,260
That's right. Star Wars and Shrek are more

57
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:09,815
similar because the cosine similarity measure between them is greater.

58
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:12,350
Check that these are the values you found when

59
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:16,050
computing the cosine similarity between these pairs of movies.
