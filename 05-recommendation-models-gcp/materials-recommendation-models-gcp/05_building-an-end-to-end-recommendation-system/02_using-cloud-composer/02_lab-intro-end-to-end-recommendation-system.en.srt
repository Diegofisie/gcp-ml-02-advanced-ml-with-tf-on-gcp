1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,710
In this final lab,

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:04,169
you'll fill in the to-dos as part of the DAG,

3
00:00:04,169 --> 00:00:06,105
and the recommendation system notebook.

4
00:00:06,105 --> 00:00:09,405
Here you'll put your knowledge to the test on each task and

5
00:00:09,405 --> 00:00:13,665
operator that's part of the production recommendation system, ML model.

6
00:00:13,665 --> 00:00:16,530
Specifically, you'll review the architecture as a whole,

7
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:19,260
and diagram the lists of tasks and services needed.

8
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,050
Then you'll set up the workflow environment inside of

9
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,895
Cloud Composer which will provide you a link to the Apache Airflow Web server URL.

10
00:00:26,895 --> 00:00:29,925
Next, you'll modify and complete the DAG file to

11
00:00:29,925 --> 00:00:33,255
automatically send task to BigQuery and Google Cloud Storage,

12
00:00:33,255 --> 00:00:35,820
to refresh the Google Analytics news articles for

13
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,415
consumption later in retraining your recommendation model.

14
00:00:39,415 --> 00:00:42,500
Next, you'll complete the DAG file with submitting

15
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,440
a job to the Cloud Machine Learning Engine to retrain the model,

16
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,110
and then a job to App Engine to redeploy the updated application endpoint.

17
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:53,570
Finally, you get to test your new application to

18
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:57,590
serve up article recommendations for users using HTTP request.

19
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:01,180
Entire app architecture will look like this in the end.

20
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:03,870
The specific pieces of the DAG that you'll complete,

21
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,060
are the four tasks names shown here.

22
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,860
So, that's it.

23
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,175
Go ahead and get started with the end-to-end recommendation system lab,

24
00:01:11,175 --> 00:01:14,210
and return back here for the solution walkthrough.
