1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
Pick a personalization need for your company,

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,325
and design a recommendation system around it.

3
00:00:05,325 --> 00:00:07,590
Think about what data you would need?

4
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:09,780
What are your features and targets?

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,995
How will you create a content-based filter, or collaborative filter?

6
00:00:13,995 --> 00:00:17,310
Do you have explicit ratings of user feedback you can use?

7
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,695
Or will you have to allow an implicit feedback?

8
00:00:19,695 --> 00:00:22,500
If so, what implicit feedback is available?

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,930
How will you address the causal problem?

10
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,570
Could you benefit from a hybrid approach?

11
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,555
Let's end this module with a quiz.

12
00:00:30,555 --> 00:00:35,145
Which of the following are good reasons to build and use a recommendation engine?

13
00:00:35,145 --> 00:00:39,680
There could be more than one right answer. That's right.

14
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,425
Even though the math behind recommender systems is really cool,

15
00:00:42,425 --> 00:00:45,200
that's not a good enough reason alone to develop one.

16
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,620
Some good reasons are that they personalize the user's experience,

17
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:53,000
or that recommenders provide a way to surface relevant content within millions of items.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,530
Like recommending YouTube videos,

19
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,515
you might never have found yourself.

20
00:00:56,515 --> 00:00:59,300
In summary, we've had a brief introduction to

21
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,240
the different types of commonly used recommender systems.

22
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:06,250
We've discussed the difference between content-based and collaborative filtering.

23
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:09,020
We've seen how a knowledge based approach can be used,

24
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:13,015
and we've seen how deep neural networks can be applied in this setting as well.

25
00:01:13,015 --> 00:01:17,420
We discussed how to design and build your own recommendation engine,

26
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,915
and we've seen some of the problems that can arise,

27
00:01:19,915 --> 00:01:23,615
either cold-start problem, or lack of explicit user feedback.

28
00:01:23,615 --> 00:01:27,415
We've also discussed ways in which these problems can be addressed.

29
00:01:27,415 --> 00:01:29,750
In the next modules, we will go deeper into

30
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:32,135
the details of how these recommender systems work,

31
00:01:32,135 --> 00:01:35,040
and even see how to build them in TensorFlow.
